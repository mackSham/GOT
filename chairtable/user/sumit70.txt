SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW.

HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY.

HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING.

TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G.

NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.

WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS.

SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.'

INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.  RELATED AND DERIVATIVE WRITINGS MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF AUTHORS OF NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES IN ADDITION TO THE HOLMES CANON, CONAN DOYLE'S 1898 "THE LOST SPECIAL" FEATURES AN UNNAMED "AMATEUR REASONER" INTENDED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS HOLMES BY HIS READERS. THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

THE AUTHOR'S EXPLANATION OF A BAFFLING DISAPPEARANCE ARGUED IN HOLMESIAN STYLE, POKES FUN AT HIS OWN CREATION. SIMILAR CONAN DOYLE SHORT STORIES ARE THE EARLY "THE FIELD BAZAAR", "THE MAN WITH THE WATCHES", AND 1924'S "HOW WATSON LEARNED THE TRICK", A PARODY OF THE WATSON–HOLMES BREAKFAST-TABLE SCENES. THE AUTHOR WROTE OTHER MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY PLAYS, FEATURING HOLMES. MUCH OF IT APPEARS IN SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE PUBLISHED APOCRYPHA, EDITED BY JACK TRACY; THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EDITED BY PETER HAINING, AND THE UNCOLLECTED SHERLOCK HOLMES, COMPILED BY RICHARD LANCELYN GREEN.  IN TERMS OF WRITERS OTHER THAN DOYLE, AUTHORS AS DIVERSE AS ANTHONY BURGESS, NEIL GAIMAN, DOROTHY B. HUGHES, STEPHEN KING, TANITH LEE, A. A. MILNE, AND P. G. WODEHOUSE HAVE ALL WRITTEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PASTICHES. NOTABLY, FAMED AMERICAN MYSTERY WRITER JOHN DICKSON CARR COLLABORATED WITH ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S SON, ADRIAN CONAN DOYLE, ON THE EXPLOITS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, A PASTICHE COLLECTION FROM 1954. IN 2011, ANTHONY HOROWITZ PUBLISHED A SHERLOCK HOLMES NOVEL, THE HOUSE OF SILK, PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF CONAN DOYLE'S WORK AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE.[88] A SEQUEL, MORIARTY, WAS PUBLISHED IN 2014.[89]  SOME AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN TALES CENTRED ON CHARACTERS FROM THE CANON OTHER THAN HOLMES. M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW. MARTIN DAVIES HAS WRITTEN THREE NOVELS WHERE BAKER STREET HOUSEKEEPER MRS. HUDSON IS THE PROTAGONIST. MYCROFT HOLMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL EFFORTS: ENTER THE LION BY MICHAEL P. HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR.

SHERLOCK HOLMES SHERLOCK HOLMES CHARACTER SHERLOCK HOLMES PORTRAIT PAGET.JPG SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A 1904 ILLUSTRATION BY SIDNEY PAGET. FIRST APPEARANCE	A STUDY IN SCARLET CREATED BY	SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE INFORMATION GENDER	MALE OCCUPATION	CONSULTING DETECTIVE FAMILY	MYCROFT HOLMES (BROTHER) NATIONALITY	BRITISH SHERLOCK HOLMES (/ˈʃɜːRLɒK ˈHOʊMZ/) IS A FICTIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH AUTHOR SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS A "CONSULTING DETECTIVE" IN THE STORIES, HOLMES IS KNOWN FOR HIS PROFICIENCY WITH OBSERVATION, FORENSIC SCIENCE, AND LOGICAL REASONING THAT BORDERS ON THE FANTASTIC, WHICH HE EMPLOYS WHEN INVESTIGATING CASES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING SCOTLAND YARD.  FIRST APPEARING IN PRINT IN 1887 (IN A STUDY IN SCARLET), THE CHARACTER'S POPULARITY BECAME WIDESPREAD WITH THE FIRST SERIES OF SHORT STORIES IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, BEGINNING WITH "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" IN 1891; ADDITIONAL TALES APPEARED FROM THEN UNTIL 1927, EVENTUALLY TOTALLING FOUR NOVELS AND 56 SHORT STORIES. ALL BUT ONE ARE SET IN THE VICTORIAN OR EDWARDIAN ERAS, BETWEEN ABOUT 1880 AND 1914. MOST ARE NARRATED BY THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES'S FRIEND AND BIOGRAPHER DR. WATSON, WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIES HOLMES DURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND OFTEN SHARES QUARTERS WITH HIM AT THE ADDRESS OF 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, WHERE MANY OF THE STORIES BEGIN.  THOUGH NOT THE FIRST FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, SHERLOCK HOLMES IS ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN, WITH GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS LISTING HIM AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER" IN HISTORY.[1] HOLMES'S POPULARITY AND FAME ARE SUCH THAT MANY HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO BE NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BUT A REAL INDIVIDUAL;[2][3][4] NUMEROUS LITERARY AND FAN SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED THAT PRETEND TO OPERATE ON THIS PRINCIPLE. WIDELY CONSIDERED A BRITISH CULTURAL ICON, THE CHARACTER AND STORIES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND AND LASTING EFFECT ON MYSTERY WRITING AND POPULAR CULTURE AS A WHOLE, WITH THE ORIGINAL TALES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OTHER THAN CONAN DOYLE BEING ADAPTED INTO STAGE AND RADIO PLAYS, TELEVISION, FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, AND OTHER MEDIA FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

PHOTO FROM 1914 EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE FIRST DETECTIVE IN FICTION AND SERVED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR MANY THAT WERE CREATED LATER, INCLUDING HOLMES.[5] CONAN DOYLE ONCE WROTE, "EACH [OF POE'S DETECTIVE STORIES] IS A ROOT FROM WHICH A WHOLE LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED... WHERE WAS THE DETECTIVE STORY UNTIL POE BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO IT?"[6] SIMILARLY, THE STORIES OF ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ WERE EXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE TIME CONAN DOYLE BEGAN WRITING HOLMES, AND HOLMES' SPEECH AND BEHAVIOUR SOMETIMES FOLLOW THAT OF LECOQ.[7] BOTH DUPIN AND LECOQ ARE REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A STUDY IN SCARLET.  CONAN DOYLE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HOLMES WAS INSPIRED BY THE REAL-LIFE FIGURE OF JOSEPH BELL, A SURGEON AT THE ROYAL INFIRMARY OF EDINBURGH, WHOM DOYLE MET IN 1877 AND HAD WORKED FOR AS A CLERK. LIKE HOLMES, BELL WAS NOTED FOR DRAWING BROAD CONCLUSIONS FROM MINUTE OBSERVATIONS.[8] HOWEVER, HE LATER WROTE TO DOYLE: "YOU ARE YOURSELF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WELL YOU KNOW IT".[9] SIR HENRY LITTLEJOHN, CHAIR OF MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL, IS ALSO CITED AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOLMES. LITTLEJOHN, WHO WAS ALSO POLICE SURGEON AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN EDINBURGH, PROVIDED DOYLE WITH A LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE DETECTION OF CRIME.[10]  OTHER INSPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. ONE IS THOUGHT TO BE FRANCIS "TANKY" SMITH, A POLICEMAN AND MASTER OF DISGUISE WHO WENT ON TO BECOME LEICESTER'S FIRST PRIVATE DETECTIVE.[11] ANOTHER MIGHT BE MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BY FRENCH AUTHOR HENRY CAUVAIN. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF CONAN DOYLE READ MAXIMILIEN HELLER, BUT IN THIS 1871 NOVEL (SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), HENRY CAUVAIN IMAGINED A DEPRESSED, ANTI-SOCIAL, POLYMATH, CAT-LOVING, AND OPIUM-SMOKING PARIS-BASED DETECTIVE.[12][13][14]  FICTIONAL CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE MAGAZINE COVER FEATURING A STUDY IN SCARLET, WITH DRAWING OF A MAN LIGHTING A LAMP THE COVER PAGE OF BEETON'S CHRISTMAS ANNUAL ISSUE WHICH CONTAINS HOLMES'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1887 (A STUDY IN SCARLET). DETAILS ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES'S LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ADVENTURES IN THE BOOKS, ARE SCARCE IN CONAN DOYLE'S ORIGINAL STORIES. NEVERTHELESS, MENTIONS OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND EXTENDED FAMILY PAINT A LOOSE BIOGRAPHICAL PICTURE OF THE DETECTIVE.  AN ESTIMATE OF HOLMES'S AGE IN "HIS LAST BOW" PLACES HIS YEAR OF BIRTH AT 1854; THE STORY, SET IN AUGUST 1914, DESCRIBES HIM AS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE.[15] HIS PARENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE STORIES, ALTHOUGH HOLMES MENTIONS THAT HIS "ANCESTORS" WERE "COUNTRY SQUIRES". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", HE CLAIMS THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS SISTER TO THE FRENCH ARTIST VERNET, WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFYING WHETHER THIS WAS CLAUDE JOSEPH, CARLE, OR HORACE VERNET. HOLMES'S BROTHER MYCROFT, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR, IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" AND IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE". MYCROFT HAS A UNIQUE CIVIL SERVICE POSITION AS A KIND OF HUMAN DATABASE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HE LACKS SHERLOCK'S INTEREST IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, PREFERRING TO SPEND HIS TIME AT THE DIOGENES CLUB.  HOLMES SAYS THAT HE FIRST DEVELOPED HIS METHODS OF DEDUCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE; HIS EARLIEST CASES, WHICH HE PURSUED AS AN AMATEUR, CAME FROM FELLOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.[16] A MEETING WITH A CLASSMATE'S FATHER LED HIM TO ADOPT DETECTION AS A PROFESSION,[17] AND HE SPENT SIX YEARS AFTER UNIVERSITY AS A CONSULTANT BEFORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED HIM TO ACCEPT JOHN H. WATSON AS A FELLOW LODGER IN 1881 (WHEN THE FIRST PUBLISHED STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, BEGINS).  THE TWO TAKE LODGINGS AT 221B BAKER STREET, LONDON, AN APARTMENT AT THE UPPER (NORTH) END OF THE STREET, UP SEVENTEEN STEPS.[18]  LIFE WITH WATSON HOLMES (IN DEERSTALKER HAT) TALKING TO WATSON (IN A BOWLER HAT) IN A RAILWAY COMPARTMENT HOLMES AND WATSON IN A SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FOR "SILVER BLAZE". HOLMES WORKED AS A DETECTIVE FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS, WITH PHYSICIAN JOHN WATSON ASSISTING HIM FOR SEVENTEEN.[19] THEY WERE ROOMMATES BEFORE WATSON'S 1887 MARRIAGE AND AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH. THEIR RESIDENCE IS MAINTAINED BY THEIR LANDLADY, MRS. HUDSON. MOST OF THE STORIES ARE FRAME NARRATIVES, WRITTEN FROM WATSON'S POINT OF VIEW AS SUMMARIES OF THE DETECTIVE'S MOST INTERESTING CASES. HOLMES FREQUENTLY CALLS WATSON'S WRITING SENSATIONAL AND POPULIST, SUGGESTING THAT IT FAILS TO ACCURATELY AND OBJECTIVELY REPORT THE "SCIENCE" OF HIS CRAFT:  DETECTION IS, OR OUGHT TO BE, AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER. YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT ["A STUDY IN SCARLET"] WITH ROMANTICISM, WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS IF YOU WORKED A LOVE-STORY ... SOME FACTS SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED, OR, AT LEAST, A JUST SENSE OF PROPORTION SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN TREATING THEM. THE ONLY POINT IN THE CASE WHICH DESERVED MENTION WAS THE CURIOUS ANALYTICAL REASONING FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES, BY WHICH I SUCCEEDED IN UNRAVELLING IT.[20]  — SHERLOCK HOLMES ON JOHN WATSON'S "PAMPHLET", THE SIGN OF THE FOUR NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES'S FRIENDSHIP WITH WATSON IS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WATSON IS INJURED BY A BULLET, ALTHOUGH THE WOUND TURNS OUT TO BE "QUITE SUPERFICIAL", WATSON IS MOVED BY HOLMES'S REACTION:  IT WAS WORTH A WOUND; IT WAS WORTH MANY WOUNDS; TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF LOYALTY AND LOVE WHICH LAY BEHIND THAT COLD MASK. THE CLEAR, HARD EYES WERE DIMMED FOR A MOMENT, AND THE FIRM LIPS WERE SHAKING. FOR THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A GREAT HEART AS WELL AS OF A GREAT BRAIN. ALL MY YEARS OF HUMBLE BUT SINGLE-MINDED SERVICE CULMINATED IN THAT MOMENT OF REVELATION.[21]  THE GREAT HIATUS HOLMES AND MORIARTY WRESTLING AT THE END OF A NARROW PATH, WITH HOLMES'S HAT FALLING INTO A WATERFALL HOLMES AND MORIARTY STRUGGLE AT THE REICHENBACH FALLS; DRAWING BY SIDNEY PAGET. THE FIRST SET OF HOLMES STORIES WAS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1887 AND 1893. WISHING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, CONAN DOYLE KILLED OFF HOLMES IN A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE CRIMINAL MASTERMIND PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" (PUBLISHED 1893, BUT SET IN 1891). AFTER RESISTING PUBLIC PRESSURE FOR EIGHT YEARS, THE AUTHOR WROTE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (SERIALISED IN 1901–1902, WITH AN IMPLICIT SETTING BEFORE HOLMES'S DEATH). IN 1903, CONAN DOYLE WROTE "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", SET IN 1894; HOLMES REAPPEARS, EXPLAINING TO A STUNNED WATSON THAT HE HAD FAKED HIS DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" TO FOOL HIS ENEMIES. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SET OF STORIES, WHICH CONAN DOYLE WROTE UNTIL 1927.  HOLMES AFICIONADOS REFER TO THE PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1894—BETWEEN HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND PRESUMED DEATH IN "THE FINAL PROBLEM" AND HIS REAPPEARANCE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"—AS THE GREAT HIATUS (THOUGH 1908'S "THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE" IS DESCRIBED AS TAKING PLACE IN 1892 DUE TO AN ERROR ON CONAN DOYLE'S PART). THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS IN THE ARTICLE "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE GREAT HIATUS" BY EDGAR W. SMITH, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 1946 ISSUE OF THE BAKER STREET JOURNAL.[22]  RETIREMENT IN "HIS LAST BOW", HOLMES HAS RETIRED TO A SMALL FARM ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS AND TAKEN UP BEEKEEPING AS HIS PRIMARY OCCUPATION. THE MOVE IS NOT DATED PRECISELY, BUT CAN BE PRESUMED TO PREDATE 1904 (SINCE IT IS REFERRED TO RETROSPECTIVELY IN "THE SECOND STAIN", FIRST PUBLISHED THAT YEAR). THE STORY FEATURES HOLMES AND WATSON COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO AID THE WAR EFFORT. ONLY ONE OTHER ADVENTURE, "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE" (NARRATED BY HOLMES), TAKES PLACE DURING THE DETECTIVE'S RETIREMENT.  PERSONALITY AND HABITS MAN ANSWERING THE DOOR TO A BOWLER-HATTED MAN IN A RAINCOAT SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION FROM "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ" WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS "BOHEMIAN" IN HIS HABITS AND LIFESTYLE. DESCRIBED BY WATSON IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES AS HAVING A "CAT-LIKE" LOVE OF PERSONAL CLEANLINESS, HOLMES IS AN ECCENTRIC WITH NO REGARD FOR CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS OF TIDINESS OR GOOD ORDER. IN MANY OF THE STORIES, HOLMES DIVES INTO AN APPARENT MESS TO FIND AN ITEM MOST RELEVANT TO A MYSTERY. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL", WATSON SAYS:  ALTHOUGH IN HIS METHODS OF THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEATEST AND MOST METHODICAL OF MANKIND ... [HE] KEEPS HIS CIGARS IN THE COAL-SCUTTLE, HIS TOBACCO IN THE TOE END OF A PERSIAN SLIPPER, AND HIS UNANSWERED CORRESPONDENCE TRANSFIXED BY A JACK-KNIFE INTO THE VERY CENTRE OF HIS WOODEN MANTELPIECE ... HE HAD A HORROR OF DESTROYING DOCUMENTS ... THUS MONTH AFTER MONTH HIS PAPERS ACCUMULATED, UNTIL EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS STACKED WITH BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH WERE ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE BURNED, AND WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY SAVE BY THEIR OWNER.[16]  THE DETECTIVE STARVES HIMSELF AT TIMES OF INTENSE INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DURING "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER"—WHEREIN, ACCORDING TO WATSON:  [HOLMES] HAD NO BREAKFAST FOR HIMSELF, FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD, AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM PURE INANITION.[23]  YOUNG MAN IN A SUIT, LOOKING LEFT SIDNEY PAGET, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STRAND MAGAZINE ICONICISED HOLMES AND WATSON. WHILE THE DETECTIVE IS USUALLY DISPASSIONATE AND COLD, DURING AN INVESTIGATION HE IS ANIMATED AND EXCITABLE. HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, PREPARING ELABORATE TRAPS TO CAPTURE AND EXPOSE A CULPRIT (OFTEN TO IMPRESS OBSERVERS).[24] HIS COMPANION CONDONES THE DETECTIVE'S WILLINGNESS TO BEND THE TRUTH (OR BREAK THE LAW) ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT—LYING TO THE POLICE, CONCEALING EVIDENCE OR BREAKING INTO HOUSES—WHEN HE FEELS IT MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE,[25] BUT CONDEMNS HOLMES' MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON". HOLMES DERIVES PLEASURE FROM BAFFLING POLICE INSPECTORS WITH HIS DEDUCTIONS AND HAS SUPREME CONFIDENCE—BORDERING ON ARROGANCE—IN HIS INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES. WHILE THE DETECTIVE DOES NOT ACTIVELY SEEK FAME AND IS USUALLY CONTENT TO LET THE POLICE TAKE PUBLIC CREDIT FOR HIS WORK,[26] HOLMES IS PLEASED WHEN HIS SKILLS ARE RECOGNISED AND RESPONDS TO FLATTERY.[27]  WATSON'S STORIES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REVEAL HOLMES'S ROLE IN THE CASES TO THE PUBLIC, AND HE BECOMES WELL KNOWN AS A DETECTIVE; SO MANY CLIENTS ASK FOR HIS HELP INSTEAD OF (OR IN ADDITION TO) THAT OF THE POLICE[28] THAT, WATSON WRITES, BY 1895 HOLMES HAS "AN IMMENSE PRACTICE".[29] POLICE OUTSIDE LONDON ASK HOLMES FOR ASSISTANCE IF HE IS NEARBY, EVEN DURING A VACATION.[27] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ROYALTY ARE AMONG THOSE HE SERVES. A PRIME MINISTER[30] AND THE KING OF BOHEMIA[31] VISIT 221B BAKER STREET TO REQUEST HOLMES'S ASSISTANCE; THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AWARDS HIM ITS LEGION OF HONOUR FOR SOLVING A CASE;[32] HOLMES DECLINES A KNIGHTHOOD "FOR SERVICES WHICH MAY PERHAPS SOME DAY BE DESCRIBED";[21] THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA IS A CLIENT;[33] AND HE AIDS THE VATICAN AT LEAST TWICE.[34] THE DETECTIVE ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY SEVERAL TIMES.[35]  EXCEPT FOR THAT OF WATSON, HOLMES AVOIDS CASUAL COMPANY; WHEN WATSON PROPOSES VISITING A FRIEND'S HOME FOR REST, HOLMES ONLY AGREES AFTER LEARNING THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A BACHELOR ONE, AND THAT HE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FULLEST FREEDOM".[27] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT", HE TELLS THE DOCTOR THAT DURING TWO YEARS AT COLLEGE HE MADE ONLY ONE FRIEND, VICTOR TREVOR: "I WAS NEVER A VERY SOCIABLE FELLOW, WATSON, ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT, SO THAT I NEVER MIXED MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR; ... MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER FELLOWS, SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL". THE DETECTIVE IS SIMILARLY DESCRIBED BY STAMFORD IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.  AS SHOOTING PRACTICE DURING A PERIOD OF BOREDOM, HOLMES DECORATES THE WALL OF HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS WITH A "PATRIOTIC" VR (VICTORIA REGINA) IN "BULLET-POCKS" FROM HIS REVOLVER.[16] HOLMES RELAXES WITH MUSIC IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", TAKING THE EVENING OFF FROM A CASE TO LISTEN TO PABLO DE SARASATE PLAY VIOLIN. HIS ENJOYMENT OF VOCAL MUSIC, PARTICULARLY WAGNER'S, IS EVIDENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE".  DRUG USE HOLMES IN A BLUE BATHROBE, RECLINING AGAINST A PILLOW AND SMOKING HIS PIPE 1891 SIDNEY PAGET STRAND PORTRAIT OF HOLMES FOR "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" HOLMES OCCASIONALLY USES ADDICTIVE DRUGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF STIMULATING CASES. HE USES COCAINE, WHICH HE INJECTS IN A SEVEN-PERCENT SOLUTION WITH A SYRINGE KEPT IN A MOROCCO LEATHER CASE. ALTHOUGH HOLMES ALSO DABBLES IN MORPHINE, HE EXPRESSES STRONG DISAPPROVAL WHEN HE VISITS AN OPIUM DEN; BOTH DRUGS WERE LEGAL IN LATE-19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND. AS A PHYSICIAN, WATSON STRONGLY DISAPPROVES OF HIS FRIEND'S COCAINE HABIT, DESCRIBING IT AS THE DETECTIVE'S "ONLY VICE", AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON HOLMES'S MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECT.[36][37] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER", WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS "WEANED" HOLMES FROM DRUGS, HE REMAINS AN ADDICT WHOSE HABIT IS "NOT DEAD, BUT MERELY SLEEPING".  WATSON AND HOLMES BOTH USE TOBACCO, SMOKING CIGARETTES, CIGARS, AND PIPES, AND HOLMES IS AN EXPERT AT IDENTIFYING TOBACCO-ASH RESIDUE. ALTHOUGH HIS CHRONICLER DOES NOT CONSIDER HOLMES'S HABITUAL USE OF A PIPE (OR HIS LESS FREQUENT USE OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARS) A VICE PER SE, WATSON—A PHYSICIAN—OCCASIONALLY CRITICISES THE DETECTIVE FOR CREATING A "POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE" OF TOBACCO SMOKE IN THEIR CONFINED QUARTERS.[38]  FINANCES DURING HIS CAREER, HOLMES WORKS FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS AND GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE (INCLUDING HIS OWN), WEALTHY ARISTOCRATS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, AND IMPOVERISHED PAWNBROKERS AND GOVERNESSES. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE STORIES BEGIN HOLMES INITIALLY NEEDED WATSON TO SHARE THE RENT FOR THEIR RESIDENCE AT 221B BAKER STREET, BY THE TIME OF "THE FINAL PROBLEM", HE SAYS THAT HIS SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE AND THE ROYAL HOUSE OF SCANDINAVIA HAD LEFT HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE COMFORTABLY. THE DETECTIVE IS KNOWN TO CHARGE CLIENTS FOR HIS EXPENSES AND CLAIM ANY REWARD OFFERED FOR A PROBLEM'S SOLUTION; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND" HE SAYS THAT HELEN STONER MAY PAY ANY EXPENSES HE INCURS AND ASKS THE BANK IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" TO REIMBURSE HIM FOR MONEY SPENT SOLVING THE CASE. HOLMES HAS HIS WEALTHY BANKER CLIENT IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET" PAY THE COSTS OF RECOVERING THE STOLEN GEMS, AND CLAIMS THE REWARD POSTED FOR THEIR RECOVERY. IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE", THE DETECTIVE SAYS, "MY PROFESSIONAL CHARGES ARE UPON A FIXED SCALE. I DO NOT VARY THEM, SAVE WHEN I REMIT [OMIT] THEM ALTOGETHER". IN THIS CONTEXT, A CLIENT IS OFFERING TO DOUBLE HIS FEE, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT WEALTHY CLIENTS HABITUALLY PAY HOLMES MORE THAN HIS STANDARD FEE.  THE DETECTIVE TELLS WATSON, IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY", ABOUT A GOLD SNUFF BOX RECEIVED FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA AFTER "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" AND ABOUT A VALUABLE RING GIVEN TO HIM BY THE DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY; IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", HE RECEIVES AN EMERALD TIE PIN FROM QUEEN VICTORIA. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", HOLMES RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE WHEN THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE MENTIONS HIS ₤6,000 FEE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH SURPRISES EVEN WATSON (AT A TIME WHERE ANNUAL EXPENSES FOR A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WERE IN THE AREA OF ₤500).[39] HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", WATSON NOTES THAT HOLMES WOULD REFUSE TO HELP EVEN THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL IF THEIR CASES DID NOT INTEREST HIM.  ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AS DOYLE WROTE TO JOSEPH BELL, "HOLMES IS AS INHUMAN AS A BABBAGE'S CALCULATING MACHINE AND JUST ABOUT AS LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE".[40] HOLMES SAYS IN THE VALLEY OF FEAR, "I AM NOT A WHOLE-SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND",[41] AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN" FINDS "THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ... INSCRUTABLE .... HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH QUICKSAND? THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTIONS MAY MEAN VOLUMES ... THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS".[42] IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE SAYS, "I WOULD NOT TELL THEM TOO MUCH. WOMEN ARE NEVER TO BE ENTIRELY TRUSTED—NOT THE BEST OF THEM". WATSON CALLS HIM "AN AUTOMATON, A CALCULATING MACHINE", AND THE DETECTIVE REPLIES: "IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE NOT TO ALLOW YOUR JUDGEMENT TO BE BIASED BY PERSONAL QUALITIES. A CLIENT IS TO ME A MERE UNIT—A FACTOR IN A PROBLEM. THE EMOTIONAL QUALITIES ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO CLEAR REASONING. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE MOST WINNING WOMAN I EVER KNEW WAS HANGED FOR POISONING THREE LITTLE CHILDREN FOR THEIR INSURANCE-MONEY".[43]  AT THE END OF THE SIGN OF FOUR, WATSON REVEALS TO HOLMES THAT "MISS MORSTAN HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ACCEPT ME AS A HUSBAND IN PROSPECTIVE."  HE GAVE A MOST DISMAL GROAN.  'I FEARED AS MUCH,' SAID HE. 'I REALLY CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU.' I WAS A LITTLE HURT. 'HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE?' I ASKED. 'NOT AT ALL. I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG LADIES I EVER MET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN SUCH WORK AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE HAD A DECIDED GENIUS THAT WAY; ... BUT LOVE IS AN EMOTIONAL THING, AND WHATEVER IS EMOTIONAL IS OPPOSED TO THAT TRUE COLD REASON WHICH I PLACE ABOVE ALL THINGS. I SHOULD NEVER MARRY MYSELF, LEST I BIAS MY JUDGEMENT.' [44]  WATSON SAYS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES" THAT THE DETECTIVE INEVITABLY "MANIFESTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE CLIENT WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS". IN "THE LION'S MANE", HOLMES WRITES, "WOMEN HAVE SELDOM BEEN AN ATTRACTION TO ME, FOR MY BRAIN HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED MY HEART," INDICATING THAT HE HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN SOME WAY ON OCCASION, BUT HAS NOT BEEN INTERESTED IN PURSUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT", HE CLAIMS OUTRIGHT THAT "I HAVE NEVER LOVED".  DESPITE HIS OVERALL ATTITUDE, HOLMES IS ADEPT AT EFFORTLESSLY PUTTING HIS CLIENTS AT EASE, AND WATSON SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH THE DETECTIVE HAS AN "AVERSION TO WOMEN", HE HAS "A PECULIARLY INGRATIATING WAY WITH [THEM]". WATSON NOTES IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" THAT MRS. HUDSON IS FOND OF HOLMES BECAUSE OF HIS "REMARKABLE GENTLENESS AND COURTESY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH WOMEN. HE DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED THE SEX, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A CHIVALROUS OPPONENT".[45] IN "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", THE DETECTIVE EASILY MANAGES TO BECOME ENGAGED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A CASE, BUT ALSO ABANDONS THE WOMAN ONCE HE HAS THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRES.  IRENE ADLER MAIN ARTICLE: IRENE ADLER IRENE ADLER IS A RETIRED AMERICAN OPERA SINGER AND ACTRESS WHO APPEARS IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA". ALTHOUGH THIS IS HER ONLY APPEARANCE, SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THE STORIES: THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER CHALLENGED HOLMES INTELLECTUALLY, AND ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO EVER BESTED HIM IN A BATTLE OF WITS. FOR THIS REASON, ADLER IS THE FREQUENT SUBJECT OF PASTICHE WRITING. THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY DESCRIBES THE HIGH REGARD IN WHICH HOLMES HOLDS HER:  TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ... YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.  FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY'S EVENTS, ADLER HAD A BRIEF LIAISON WITH CROWN PRINCE OF BOHEMIA WILHELM VON ORMSTEIN WHILE SHE WAS PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW. RECENTLY ENGAGED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA AND FEARFUL THAT, IF HIS FIANCéE'S FAMILY LEARNED OF THIS IMPROPRIETY, THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE CALLED OFF, ORMSTEIN HIRES HOLMES TO REGAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER AND HIMSELF. ADLER SLIPS AWAY BEFORE HOLMES CAN SUCCEED, LEAVING ONLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HERSELF (ALONE) AND A NOTE TO HOLMES THAT SHE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ORMSTEIN.  HER MEMORY IS KEPT ALIVE BY THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ADLER THAT HOLMES RECEIVED FOR HIS PART IN THE CASE.  KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THE FIRST NOVEL, A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES' BACKGROUND IS PRESENTED. IN EARLY 1881, HE IS A CHEMISTRY STUDENT WITH A NUMBER OF ECCENTRIC INTERESTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIM ADEPT AT SOLVING CRIMES. SHORTLY AFTER MEETING HOLMES, WATSON ASSESSES THE DETECTIVE'S ABILITIES:  KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY – NIL. KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS – FEEBLE. KNOWLEDGE OF BOTANY – VARIABLE. WELL UP IN BELLADONNA, OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY. KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING. KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY – PRACTICAL, BUT LIMITED. TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER. AFTER WALKS, HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS, AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM. KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY – PROFOUND. KNOWLEDGE OF ANATOMY – ACCURATE, BUT UNSYSTEMATIC. KNOWLEDGE OF SENSATIONAL LITERATURE – IMMENSE. HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY. PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL. IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER, BOXER AND SWORDSMAN. HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, A STUDY IN SCARLET  SUBSEQUENT STORIES REVEAL THAT WATSON'S EARLY ASSESSMENT WAS INCOMPLETE IN PLACES AND INACCURATE IN OTHERS. AT THE END OF A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN. DESPITE HOLMES'S SUPPOSED IGNORANCE OF POLITICS, IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISES THE TRUE IDENTITY OF "COUNT VON KRAMM". HIS SPEECH IS PEPPERED WITH REFERENCES TO THE BIBLE, SHAKESPEARE, AND JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, AND THE DETECTIVE QUOTES A LETTER FROM GUSTAVE FLAUBERT TO GEORGE SAND IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH. AT THE END OF "A CASE OF IDENTITY", HOLMES QUOTES HAFEZ. IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE DETECTIVE RECOGNISES WORKS BY MARTIN KNOLLER AND JOSHUA REYNOLDS: "EXCUSE THE ADMIRATION OF A CONNOISSEUR .... WATSON WON'T ALLOW THAT I KNOW ANYTHING OF ART, BUT THAT IS MERE JEALOUSY SINCE OUR VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT DIFFER". IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS", WATSON SAYS THAT IN NOVEMBER 1895, "HOLMES LOST HIMSELF IN A MONOGRAPH WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN UPON THE POLYPHONIC MOTETS OF LASSUS", CONSIDERED "THE LAST WORD" ON THE SUBJECT.[46] HOLMES IS ALSO A CRYPTANALYST, TELLING WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN": "I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET WRITING, AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT, IN WHICH I ANALYSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS".[47]  IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, HOLMES CLAIMS TO BE UNAWARE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN SINCE SUCH INFORMATION IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS WORK; AFTER HEARING THAT FACT FROM WATSON, HE SAYS HE WILL IMMEDIATELY TRY TO FORGET IT. THE DETECTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE MIND HAS A FINITE CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION STORAGE, AND LEARNING USELESS THINGS REDUCES ONE'S ABILITY TO LEARN USEFUL THINGS. THE LATER STORIES MOVE AWAY FROM THIS NOTION: IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE VALLEY OF FEAR, HE SAYS, "ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES USEFUL TO THE DETECTIVE", AND NEAR THE END OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE", THE DETECTIVE CALLS HIMSELF "AN OMNIVOROUS READER WITH A STRANGELY RETENTIVE MEMORY FOR TRIFLES".  THE DETECTIVE IS PARTICULARLY SKILLED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING LATENT PRINTS (SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, HOOF PRINTS, AND BICYCLE TRACKS) TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS AT A CRIME SCENE (A STUDY IN SCARLET, "THE ADVENTURE OF SILVER BLAZE", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, "THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY"); USING TOBACCO ASHES AND CIGARETTE BUTTS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINALS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE RESIDENT PATIENT", THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES); COMPARING TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS TO EXPOSE A FRAUD ("A CASE OF IDENTITY"); USING GUNPOWDER RESIDUE TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE REIGATE SQUIRE"); COMPARING BULLETS FROM TWO CRIME SCENES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE"); ANALYZING SMALL PIECES OF HUMAN REMAINS TO EXPOSE TWO MURDERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX"), AND AN EARLY USE OF FINGERPRINTS ("THE NORWOOD BUILDER").  HOLMES DEMONSTRATES A KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", LURING IRENE ADLER INTO BETRAYING WHERE SHE HID A PHOTOGRAPH BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WILL SAVE HER MOST VALUED POSSESSION FROM A FIRE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE", WHERE HOLMES OBTAINS INFORMATION FROM A SALESMAN WITH A WAGER: "WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN' PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET .... I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM, THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A WAGER".  MARIA KONNIKOVA POINTS OUT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH D. J. GROTHE THAT HOLMES PRACTICES WHAT IS NOW CALLED MINDFULNESS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE THING AT A TIME, AND ALMOST NEVER "MULTITASKS." SHE ADDS THAT IN THIS HE PREDATES THE SCIENCE SHOWING HOW HELPFUL THIS IS TO THE BRAIN.[48]  HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION PAINTING OF A SEATED MAN, LIGHTING A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTENTLY TO THE SIDE POSTER FOR THE 1900 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES BY CONAN DOYLE AND ACTOR WILLIAM GILLETTE HOLMES'S PRIMARY INTELLECTUAL DETECTION METHOD IS ABDUCTIVE REASONING.[49][50] HOLMESIAN DEDUCTION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OBSERVATION-BASED INFERENCES, SUCH AS HIS STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES.[49][51][52] "FROM A DROP OF WATER", HE WRITES, "A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER".[53]  IN "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", HOLMES DEDUCES THAT WATSON HAD GOTTEN WET LATELY AND HAD "A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL". WHEN WATSON ASKS HOW HOLMES KNOWS THIS, THE DETECTIVE ANSWERS:  IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF ... MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY.  IN THE FIRST HOLMES STORY, A STUDY IN SCARLET, DR. WATSON COMPARES HOLMES TO C. AUGUSTE DUPIN, EDGAR ALLAN POE'S FICTIONAL DETECTIVE, WHO EMPLOYED A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. TO THIS HOLMES REPLIES: "IN MY OPINION, DUPIN WAS A VERY INFERIOR FELLOW... HE HAD SOME ANALYTICAL GENIUS, NO DOUBT; BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS POE APPEARS TO IMAGINE". ALLUDING TO AN EPISODE IN "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE", WHERE DUPIN DEDUCES WHAT HIS FRIEND IS THINKING DESPITE THEIR HAVING WALKED TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, HOLMES REMARKS: "THAT TRICK OF HIS BREAKING IN ON HIS FRIEND'S THOUGHTS WITH AN APROPOS REMARK... IS REALLY VERY SHOWY AND SUPERFICIAL".[53] NEVERTHELESS, HOLMES LATER PERFORMS THE SAME 'TRICK' ON WATSON IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX".  DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS HOLMES TO LEARN A STRANGER'S OCCUPATION, SUCH AS THE RETIRED MARINE SERGEANT IN A STUDY IN SCARLET; THE SHIP'S-CARPENTER-TURNED-PAWNBROKER IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE", AND THE BILLIARD-MARKER AND RETIRED ARTILLERY NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GREEK INTERPRETER". BY STUDYING INANIMATE OBJECTS, HE MAKES DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THEIR OWNERS (WATSON'S POCKET WATCH IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND A HAT,[54] PIPE,[55] AND WALKING STICK[56] IN OTHER STORIES). THE DETECTIVE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE, AS HE SAYS IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STORIES, IS: "WHEN YOU HAVE ELIMINATED THE IMPOSSIBLE, WHATEVER REMAINS, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, MUST BE THE TRUTH".[57]  CONAN DOYLE DOES PAINT HOLMES AS FALLIBLE (THIS BEING A CENTRAL THEME OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW FACE").[55]  DISGUISES HOLMES DISPLAYS A STRONG APTITUDE FOR ACTING AND DISGUISE. IN SEVERAL STORIES ("THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON", "THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" AND "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), TO GATHER EVIDENCE UNDERCOVER HE USES DISGUISES SO CONVINCING THAT WATSON FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM. IN OTHERS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" AND, AGAIN, "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA"), HOLMES FEIGNS INJURY OR ILLNESS TO INCRIMINATE THE GUILTY. IN THE LATTER STORY, WATSON SAYS, "THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR ... WHEN [HOLMES] BECAME A SPECIALIST IN CRIME".[58]  AGENTS UNTIL WATSON'S ARRIVAL AT BAKER STREET HOLMES LARGELY WORKED ALONE, ONLY OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYING AGENTS FROM THE CITY'S UNDERCLASS; THESE AGENTS INCLUDED A HOST OF INFORMANTS, SUCH AS LANGDALE PIKE, A “HUMAN BOOK OF REFERENCE UPON ALL MATTERS OF SOCIAL SCANDAL”,[59] AND SHINWELL JOHNSON, AKA “PORKY” JOHNSON, WHO ACTED AS HOLMES’ “AGENT IN THE HUGE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD OF LONDON...”.[60] THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF HOLMES' AGENTS ARE A GROUP OF STREET CHILDREN HE CALLED "THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS". THE IRREGULARS APPEAR IN THREE STORIES: A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN".  COMBAT LONG-BARRELED REVOLVER WITH A BLACK HANDLE BRITISH ARMY (ADAMS) MARK III, WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE MARK II IN ITS EJECTOR-ROD DESIGN SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER WITH YELLOW HANDLE AND ITS BULLET WEBLEY BULLDOG SILVER-COLOURED REVOLVER, FACING LEFT (UNLIKE TWO PICTURES ABOVE) 1868 WEBLEY RIC PISTOLS HOLMES AND WATSON CARRY PISTOLS WITH THEM—IN WATSON'S CASE, HIS OLD SERVICE WEAPON (PROBABLY A MARK III ADAMS REVOLVER, ISSUED TO BRITISH TROOPS DURING THE 1870S). IN THE STORIES, THE PISTOLS ARE USED (OR DISPLAYED) ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. IN "THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL" HOLMES IS DESCRIBED AS DECORATING THE WALL OF HIS FLAT WITH A PATRIOTIC VR (VICTORIA REGINA) OF BULLET HOLES. HOLMES AND WATSON SHOOT THE EPONYMOUS HOUND IN THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" HOLMES PISTOL-WHIPS COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST", "THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER", AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN", HOLMES OR WATSON USE A PISTOL TO CAPTURE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE DETECTIVE USES WATSON'S REVOLVER TO RECONSTRUCT A CRIME IN "THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE". A WEBLEY BULLDOG (CARRIED BY HOLMES), WEBLEY RIC, AND WEBLEY-GOVERNMENT ("WG") ARMY REVOLVER HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES AND WATSON.[61]  CANE AND SWORD AS A GENTLEMAN, HOLMES OFTEN CARRIES A STICK OR CANE. HE IS DESCRIBED BY WATSON AS AN EXPERT AT SINGLESTICK AND USES HIS CANE TWICE AS A WEAPON.[62] IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN, AND IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" THE DETECTIVE PRACTISES FENCING.  RIDING CROP IN SEVERAL STORIES, HOLMES CARRIES A RIDING CROP, THREATENING TO THRASH A SWINDLER WITH IT IN "A CASE OF IDENTITY". WITH A "HUNTING CROP", HOLMES KNOCKS A PISTOL FROM JOHN CLAY'S HAND IN "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE" AND DRIVES OFF THE ADDER IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND". IN "THE SIX NAPOLEONS", HE USES HIS CROP (DESCRIBED AS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON) TO BREAK OPEN ONE OF THE PLASTER BUSTS.  BOXING HOLMES IS AN ADEPT BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHTER; IN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO MCMURDO, A PRIZE FIGHTER, AS "THE AMATEUR WHO FOUGHT THREE ROUNDS WITH YOU AT ALISON'S ROOMS ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR BENEFIT FOUR YEARS BACK." MCMURDO REMEMBERS: "AH, YOU'RE ONE THAT HAS WASTED YOUR GIFTS, YOU HAVE! YOU MIGHT HAVE AIMED HIGH IF YOU HAD JOINED THE FANCY." "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT" MENTIONS THAT HOLMES TRAINED AS A BOXER, AND IN "THE YELLOW FACE", WATSON SAYS: "HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN".  THE DETECTIVE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES (IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST" AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY") AND IS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS.  MARTIAL ARTS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE", HOLMES TELLS WATSON THAT HE USED MARTIAL ARTS TO FLING MORIARTY TO HIS DEATH IN THE REICHENBACH FALLS: "I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ... OF BARITSU, OR THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING, WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME". "BARITSU" IS CONAN DOYLE'S VERSION OF BARTITSU, WHICH COMBINED JUJITSU WITH BOXING AND CANE FENCING.[63]  PHYSICAL STRENGTH THE DETECTIVE IS DESCRIBED (OR DEMONSTRATED) AS POSSESSING ABOVE-AVERAGE PHYSICAL STRENGTH. IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", DR. ROYLOTT DEMONSTRATES HIS STRENGTH BY BENDING A FIRE POKER IN HALF. WATSON DESCRIBES HOLMES AS LAUGHING, "'I AM NOT QUITE SO BULKY, BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN.' AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND, WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN." IN "THE YELLOW FACE", HOLMES'S CHRONICLER SAYS, "FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT."  INFLUENCE COLOUR ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES BENDING OVER A DEAD MAN IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATION OF HOLMES FOR "THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE" FORENSIC SCIENCE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES HELPED MARRY FORENSIC SCIENCE, PARTICULARLY HOLMES' ACUTE OBSERVATION OF SMALL CLUES, AND LITERATURE. HE USES TRACE EVIDENCE (SUCH AS SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS), FINGERPRINTS, BALLISTICS, AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE HIS THEORIES AND THOSE OF THE POLICE. SOME OF THE DETECTIVE'S INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINGERPRINT AND HANDWRITING ANALYSIS, WERE IN THEIR INFANCY WHEN THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN; HOLMES FREQUENTLY LAMENTS THE CONTAMINATION OF A CRIME SCENE, AND CRIME-SCENE INTEGRITY HAS BECOME STANDARD INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE.  BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCALE OF MUCH OF HIS EVIDENCE (TOBACCO ASH, HAIR, OR FINGERPRINTS), THE DETECTIVE OFTEN USES A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE SCENE AND AN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE AT HIS BAKER STREET LODGINGS. HE USES ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FOR BLOOD RESIDUE ANALYSIS AND TOXICOLOGY TO DETECT POISONS; HOLMES'S HOME CHEMISTRY LABORATORY IS MENTIONED IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE NAVAL TREATY". BALLISTICS FEATURE IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" WHEN SPENT BULLETS ARE RECOVERED AND MATCHED WITH A SUSPECTED MURDER WEAPON.  HOLMES OBSERVES THE DRESS AND ATTITUDE OF HIS CLIENTS AND SUSPECTS, NOTING STYLE AND STATE OF WEAR OF THEIR CLOTHES, SKIN MARKS (SUCH AS TATTOOS), CONTAMINATION (SUCH AS INK STAINS OR CLAY ON BOOTS), THEIR STATE OF MIND, AND PHYSICAL CONDITION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THEIR ORIGINS AND RECENT HISTORY.  SEE CAPTION 19TH-CENTURY SEIBERT MICROSCOPE HE ALSO APPLIES THIS METHOD TO WALKING STICKS (THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) AND HATS ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE"), WITH DETAILS SUCH AS MEDALLIONS, WEAR, AND CONTAMINATION YIELDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWNERS. IN 2002, THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY BESTOWED AN HONORARY FELLOWSHIP ON HOLMES[64] FOR HIS USE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN POPULAR LITERATURE, MAKING HIM (AS OF 2015) THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER THUS HONOURED.  THE DETECTIVE STORY ALTHOUGH HOLMES IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FICTIONAL DETECTIVE (HE WAS INFLUENCED BY EDGAR ALLAN POE'S C. AUGUSTE DUPIN AND ÉMILE GABORIAU'S MONSIEUR LECOQ), HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ROLE. THE INVESTIGATING DETECTIVE (SUCH AS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S HERCULE POIROT AND DOROTHY L. SAYERS' LORD PETER WIMSEY) BECAME A POPULAR CHARACTER FOR A NUMBER OF AUTHORS.  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE JOHN RADFORD (1999) SPECULATED ON HOLMES'S INTELLIGENCE.[65] USING CONAN DOYLE'S STORIES AS DATA, HE APPLIED THREE METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE DETECTIVE'S INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND CONCLUDED THAT HIS IQ WAS ABOUT 190. SNYDER (2004) EXAMINED HOLMES'S METHODS IN THE CONTEXT OF MID- TO LATE-19TH-CENTURY CRIMINOLOGY, AND KEMPSTER (2006) COMPARED NEUROLOGISTS' SKILLS WITH THOSE DEMONSTRATED BY THE DETECTIVE.[66][67] DIDIERJEAN AND GOBET (2008) REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPERTISE, USING HOLMES AS A MODEL.[68]  LEGACY "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM, LONDON CLUTTERED DESK WITH BOOKS, JARS, SCULPTED ELEPHANTS AND OTHER OBJECTS STUDY CLUTTERED ROOM WITH FIREPLACE, THREE ARMCHAIRS AND A VIOLIN DRAWING ROOM THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS NEVER UTTERED BY HOLMES IN THE SIXTY STORIES WRITTEN BY CONAN DOYLE. HE OFTEN OBSERVES THAT HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE "ELEMENTARY", HOWEVER, AND OCCASIONALLY CALLS WATSON "MY DEAR WATSON". ONE OF THE NEAREST APPROXIMATIONS OF THE PHRASE APPEARS IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROOKED MAN" WHEN HOLMES EXPLAINS A DEDUCTION: "'EXCELLENT!' I CRIED. 'ELEMENTARY,' SAID HE."[69][70]  WILLIAM GILLETTE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE ORIGINATED THE PHRASE WITH THE FORMULATION, "OH, THIS IS ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW", ALLEGEDLY IN HIS 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. HOWEVER, THE SCRIPT WAS REVISED NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF SOME THREE DECADES OF REVIVALS AND PUBLICATIONS, AND THE PHRASE IS PRESENT IN SOME VERSIONS OF THE SCRIPT, BUT NOT OTHERS.  THE EXACT PHRASE, AS WELL AS CLOSE VARIANTS, CAN BE SEEN IN NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL ARTICLES AS EARLY AS 1909; THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT WAS CLICHéD EVEN THEN.[71] THE PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR FELLOW, QUITE ELEMENTARY" APPEARS IN P. G. WODEHOUSE'S NOVEL, PSMITH IN THE CITY (1909–1910),[70] AND "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON, ELEMENTARY" IN HIS 1915 NOVEL PSMITH, JOURNALIST (NEITHER SPOKEN BY HOLMES).[72] THE EXACT PHRASE "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" IS USED BY PROTAGONIST TOM BERESFORD IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 1922 NOVEL THE SECRET ADVERSARY. IT ALSO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE 1929 FILM THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE FIRST HOLMES SOUND FILM.[69] THE PHRASE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN PART DUE TO ITS USE IN THE RATHBONE-BRUCE SERIES OF FILMS FROM 1939 TO 1946.[73]  THE GREAT GAME MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCKIAN GAME OVERHEAD FLOOR PLAN OF HOLMES'S LODGINGS RUSS STUTLER'S VIEW OF 221B BAKER STREET CONAN DOYLE'S 56 SHORT STORIES AND FOUR NOVELS ARE KNOWN AS THE "CANON" BY HOLMES AFICIONADOS. EARLY CANONICAL SCHOLARS INCLUDED RONALD KNOX IN BRITAIN[74] AND CHRISTOPHER MORLEY IN NEW YORK.[75] MORLEY FOUNDED THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS — THE FIRST SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE HOLMES CANON — IN 1934.[76]  THE SHERLOCKIAN GAME (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HOLMESIAN GAME, THE GREAT GAME, OR SIMPLY THE GAME) ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANOMALIES AND CLARIFY DETAILS ABOUT HOLMES AND WATSON FROM THE CONAN DOYLE CANON. THE GAME, WHICH TREATS HOLMES AND WATSON AS REAL PEOPLE (AND CONAN DOYLE AS WATSON'S LITERARY AGENT), COMBINES HISTORY WITH ASPECTS OF THE STORIES TO CONSTRUCT BIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF THESE ASPECTS. RONALD KNOX IS CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE GAME.[77]  ONE DETAIL ANALYZED IN THE GAME IS HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, WITH MORLEY CONTENDING THAT THE DETECTIVE WAS BORN ON 6 JANUARY 1854.[78][79] LAURIE R. KING ALSO SPECULATED ABOUT HOLMES'S BIRTHDATE, BASED ON A STUDY IN SCARLET AND "THE ADVENTURE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT"; DETAILS IN "GLORIA SCOTT" INDICATE THAT HOLMES FINISHED HIS SECOND (AND FINAL) YEAR OF UNIVERSITY IN 1880 OR 1885. WATSON'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN WOUNDING IN THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR AND RETURN TO ENGLAND IN A STUDY IN SCARLET PLACE HIS MOVING IN WITH HOLMES IN EARLY 1881 OR 1882. ACCORDING TO KING, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HOLMES LEFT UNIVERSITY IN 1880; IF HE BEGAN UNIVERSITY AT AGE 17, HIS BIRTH YEAR WOULD PROBABLY BE 1861.[80]  ANOTHER TOPIC OF ANALYSIS IS THE UNIVERSITY HOLMES ATTENDED. DOROTHY L. SAYERS SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN DETAILS IN TWO OF THE ADVENTURES, THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE RATHER THAN OXFORD: "OF ALL THE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES, SIDNEY SUSSEX (COLLEGE) PERHAPS OFFERED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN HOLMES'S POSITION AND, IN DEFAULT OF MORE EXACT INFORMATION, WE MAY TENTATIVELY PLACE HIM THERE".[81]  HOLMES'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECTS OF ANALYSIS IN THE GAME. AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, IN A STUDY IN SCARLET, THE DETECTIVE WARNS WATSON THAT HE GETS "IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES" AND DOESN'T OPEN HIS "MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END". LESLIE S. KLINGER (EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) HAS SUGGESTED THAT HOLMES EXHIBITS SIGNS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER, WITH INTENSE ENTHUSIASM FOLLOWED BY INDOLENT SELF-ABSORPTION. OTHER MODERN READERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HOLMES MAY HAVE ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, BASED ON HIS INTENSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS, LACK OF INTEREST IN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN MONOLOGUES.[82] THE DETECTIVE'S ISOLATION AND DISTRUST OF WOMEN IS SAID TO SUGGEST A DESIRE TO ESCAPE, WITH WILLIAM BARING-GOULD (AUTHOR OF SHERLOCK HOLMES OF BAKER STREET: A LIFE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE) AND OTHERS—INCLUDING NICHOLAS MEYER, IN HIS 1974 NOVEL THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION—IMPLYING A FAMILY TRAUMA, THE MURDER OF HOLMES'S MOTHER, AS THE CAUSE.[CITATION NEEDED]  SOCIETIES MAIN ARTICLE: SHERLOCK FANDOM STATUE OF HOLMES, HOLDING A PIPE STATUE OF HOLMES IN AN INVERNESS CAPE AND A DEERSTALKER CAP ON PICARDY PLACE IN EDINBURGH (CONAN DOYLE'S BIRTHPLACE) IN 1934, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY (IN LONDON) AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS (IN NEW YORK) WERE FOUNDED. BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, ALTHOUGH THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY WAS DISSOLVED IN 1937 AND REVIVED IN 1951. THE LONDON SOCIETY IS ONE OF MANY WORLDWIDE WHO ARRANGE VISITS TO THE SCENES OF HOLMES ADVENTURES, SUCH AS THE REICHENBACH FALLS IN THE SWISS ALPS.  THE TWO SOCIETIES FOUNDED IN 1934 WERE FOLLOWED BY MANY MORE HOLMESIAN CIRCLES, FIRST IN THE U.S. (WHERE THEY ARE KNOWN AS "SCION SOCIETIES"—OFFSHOOTS—OF THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS) AND THEN IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK. THERE ARE AT LEAST 250 SHERLOCKIAN SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, CANADA (THE BOOTMAKERS OF TORONTO), INDIA, AND JAPAN (WHOSE SOCIETY HAS 80,000 MEMBERS).[83]  MUSEUMS FOR THE 1951 FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, HOLMES'S LIVING ROOM WAS RECONSTRUCTED AS PART OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES EXHIBITION, WITH A COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL. AFTER THE FESTIVAL, ITEMS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHERLOCK HOLMES (A LONDON PUB) AND THE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION HOUSED IN LUCENS, SWITZERLAND BY THE AUTHOR'S SON, ADRIAN.[83] BOTH EXHIBITIONS, EACH WITH A BAKER STREET SITTING-ROOM RECONSTRUCTION, ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  IN 1990, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSEUM OPENED ON BAKER STREET IN LONDON, FOLLOWED THE NEXT YEAR BY A MUSEUM IN MEIRINGEN (NEAR THE REICHENBACH FALLS) DEDICATED TO THE DETECTIVE.[83] A PRIVATE CONAN DOYLE COLLECTION IS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE PORTSMOUTH CITY MUSEUM, WHERE THE AUTHOR LIVED AND WORKED AS A PHYSICIAN.[84]  OTHER HONOURS THE LONDON METROPOLITAN RAILWAY NAMED ONE OF ITS 20 ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES DEPLOYED IN THE 1920S FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE WAS THE ONLY FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO HONOURED, ALONG WITH EMINENT BRITONS SUCH AS LORD BYRON, BENJAMIN DISRAELI, AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.[85][86]  A NUMBER OF LONDON STREETS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES. YORK MEWS SOUTH, OFF CRAWFORD STREET, WAS RENAMED SHERLOCK MEWS, AND WATSON'S MEWS IS NEAR CRAWFORD PLACE.[87]  ADAPTATIONS AND DERIVED WORKS THE POPULARITY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS MEANT THAT MANY WRITERS OTHER THAN ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAVE CREATED TALES OF THE DETECTIVE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEDIA, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FIDELITY TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS, STORIES, AND SETTING. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES: PASTICHES, PARODIES, AND COPIES BY PETER RIDGWAY WATT AND JOSEPH GREEN, THE FIRST KNOWN PERIOD PASTICHE DATES FROM 1893. TITLED "THE LATE SHERLOCK HOLMES", IT CAME FROM THE PEN OF DOYLE'S CLOSE FRIEND, J. M. BARRIE, WHO WAS TO CREATE PETER PAN A DECADE LATER. A COMMON PASTICHE APPROACH IS TO CREATE A NEW STORY FULLY DETAILING AN OTHERWISE-PASSING CANONICAL REFERENCE (SUCH AS AN ASIDE BY DOYLE MENTIONING THE "GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, A STORY FOR WHICH THE WORLD IS NOT YET PREPARED" IN "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE"). OTHER ADAPTATIONS HAVE SEEN THE CHARACTER TAKEN IN RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR PLACED IN DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN UNIVERSES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOLMES FALLS IN LOVE AND MARRIES IN LAURIE R. KING'S MARY RUSSELL SERIES, IS RE-ANIMATED AFTER HIS DEATH TO FIGHT FUTURE CRIME IN THE ANIMATED SERIES SHERLOCK HOLMES IN THE 22ND CENTURY, AND IS MESHED WITH THE SETTING OF H. P. LOVECRAFT'S CTHULHU MYTHOS IN NEIL GAIMAN'S "A STUDY IN EMERALD" (WHICH WON THE 2004 HUGO AWARD FOR BEST SHORT STORY). AN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL PASTICHE WAS NICHOLAS MEYER'S THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION, A 1974 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING NOVEL IN WHICH HOLMES'S COCAINE ADDICTION HAS PROGRESSED TO THE POINT OF ENDANGERING HIS CAREER. IT WAS MADE INTO A FILM OF THE SAME NAME IN 1976 AND POPULARISED THE PASTICHE-WRITING TREND OF INCORPORATING CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES (SUCH AS OSCAR WILDE, ALEISTER CROWLEY, OR JACK THE RIPPER) INTO TALES FEATURING HOLMES, SOMETHING CONAN DOYLE HIMSELF NEVER DID.

M. J. TROW HAS WRITTEN A SERIES OF SEVENTEEN BOOKS USING INSPECTOR LESTRADE AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER, BEGINNING WITH THE ADVENTURES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE IN 1985. CAROLE NELSON DOUGLAS' IRENE ADLER SERIES IS BASED ON "THE WOMAN" FROM "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", WITH THE FIRST BOOK (1990'S GOOD NIGHT, MR. HOLMES) RETELLING THAT STORY FROM ADLER'S POINT OF VIEW.

HODEL AND SEAN M. WRIGHT (1979), A FOUR-BOOK SERIES BY QUINN FAWCETT, AND 2015'S MYCROFT, BY FORMER NBA STAR KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. JOHN GARDNER, MICHAEL KURLAND, AND KIM NEWMAN, AMONGST MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALL WRITTEN TALES IN WHICH HOLMES'S NEMESIS PROFESSOR MORIARTY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER. ANTHOLOGIES EDITED BY MICHAEL KURLAND AND GEORGE MANN ARE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO STORIES TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHARACTERS OTHER THAN HOLMES AND WATSON.  IN THE 1980 ITALIAN NOVEL THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO, THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WILLIAM OF BASKERVILLE ALLUDES TO THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, AND HIS DESCRIPTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO DR. WATSON'S DESCRIPTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WHEN HE FIRST MAKES HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN A STUDY IN SCARLET.[90]  LAURIE R. KING RECREATED HOLMES IN HER MARY RUSSELL SERIES (BEGINNING WITH 1994'S THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE), SET DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE 1920S. HER HOLMES, SEMI-RETIRED IN SUSSEX, IS STUMBLED UPON BY A TEENAGED AMERICAN GIRL. RECOGNISING A KINDRED SPIRIT, HE TRAINS HER AS HIS APPRENTICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY MARRIES HER. AS OF 2016, THE SERIES INCLUDES FOURTEEN NOVELS AND A NOVELLA TIED INTO A BOOK FROM KING'S KATE MARTINELLI SERIES (THE ART OF DETECTION).  THE FINAL SOLUTION, A 2004 NOVELLA BY MICHAEL CHABON, CONCERNS AN UNNAMED BUT LONG-RETIRED DETECTIVE INTERESTED IN BEEKEEPING WHO TACKLES THE CASE OF A MISSING PARROT BELONGING TO A JEWISH REFUGEE BOY. MITCH CULLIN'S NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND (2005) TAKES PLACE TWO YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND EXPLORES AN OLD AND FRAIL SHERLOCK HOLMES (NOW 93) AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH A LIFE SPENT IN EMOTIONLESS LOGIC; THIS WAS ALSO ADAPTED INTO A FILM, 2015'S MR. HOLMES.  ADAPTATIONS IN OTHER MEDIA MAIN ARTICLE: ADAPTATIONS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FURTHER INFORMATION: LIST OF ACTORS WHO HAVE PLAYED SHERLOCK HOLMES  BASIL RATHBONE AS HOLMES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS HAS LISTED HOLMES AS THE "MOST PORTRAYED MOVIE CHARACTER",[1] WITH MORE THAN 70 ACTORS PLAYING THE PART IN OVER 200 FILMS. HIS FIRST SCREEN APPEARANCE WAS IN THE 1900 MUTOSCOPE FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES BAFFLED.[91] THE DETECTIVE HAS APPEARED IN MANY FOREIGN-LANGUAGE VERSIONS, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN MINISERIES BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER 2013.[92]  WILLIAM GILLETTE'S 1899 PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES, OR THE STRANGE CASE OF MISS FAULKNER WAS A SYNTHESIS OF FOUR CONAN DOYLE STORIES: "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA", "THE FINAL PROBLEM", "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES", AND A STUDY IN SCARLET. IN ADDITION TO ITS POPULARITY, THE PLAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT, RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL STORIES, INTRODUCED THE KEY VISUAL QUALITIES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HOLMES TODAY: HIS DEERSTALKER HAT AND CALABASH PIPE. IT ALSO FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE GILLETTE'S 1916 FILM, SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN HIS LIFETIME, GILLETTE PERFORMED AS HOLMES SOME 1,300 TIMES. IN THE EARLY 1900S, H. A. SAINTSBURY TOOK OVER THE ROLE FROM GILLETTE FOR A TOUR OF THE PLAY. BETWEEN THIS PLAY AND CONAN DOYLE'S OWN STAGE ADAPTATION OF "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND", SAINTSBURY PORTRAYED HOLMES OVER 1,000 TIMES.[93]  BASIL RATHBONE PLAYED HOLMES AND NIGEL BRUCE PLAYED WATSON IN FOURTEEN U.S. FILMS (TWO FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX AND A DOZEN FOR UNIVERSAL PICTURES) FROM 1939 TO 1946, AND IN THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ON THE MUTUAL RADIO NETWORK FROM 1939 TO 1946 (BEFORE THE ROLE OF HOLMES PASSED TO TOM CONWAY). WHILE THE FOX FILMS WERE PERIOD PIECES, THE UNIVERSAL FILMS WERE DISTINCTIVE FOR ABANDONING VICTORIAN BRITAIN AND MOVING TO A THEN-CONTEMPORARY SETTING IN WHICH HOLMES OCCASIONALLY BATTLED NAZIS.  THE 1984–1985 ITALIAN/JAPANESE ANIME SERIES SHERLOCK HOUND ADAPTED THE HOLMES STORIES FOR CHILDREN, WITH ITS CHARACTERS BEING ANTHROPOMORPHIC DOGS. THE SERIES WAS CO-DIRECTED BY HAYAO MIYAZAKI.[94]  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986, SOVIET TELEVISION PRODUCED A SERIES OF FIVE TELEVISION FILMS, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON.[95] THE SERIES WERE SPLIT INTO ELEVEN EPISODES AND STARRED VASILY LIVANOV AS HOLMES AND VITALY SOLOMIN AS WATSON. LIVANOV WAS APPOINTED AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE[96] FOR A PERFORMANCE AMBASSADOR ANTHONY BRENTON DESCRIBED AS "ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN".[95]   JEREMY BRETT AS HOLMES IN THE GRANADA SERIES JEREMY BRETT IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE HOLMES BY CRITIC JULIAN WOLFREYS.[97] BRETT PLAYED THE DETECTIVE IN FOUR SERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR BRITAIN'S GRANADA TELEVISION FROM 1984 TO 1994 AND APPEARED AS HOLMES ON STAGE. WATSON WAS PLAYED BY DAVID BURKE AND EDWARD HARDWICKE IN THE SERIES.  BERT COULES PENNED THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES[98] STARRING CLIVE MERRISON AS HOLMES AND MICHAEL WILLIAMS/ANDREW SACHS AS WATSON,[99] BASED ON THROWAWAY REFERENCES IN DOYLE'S SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS.[98] HE ALSO PRODUCED ORIGINAL SCRIPTS FOR THIS SERIES, WHICH WAS ALSO ISSUED ON CD.[100] COULES HAD PREVIOUSLY DRAMATISED THE ENTIRE HOLMES CANON FOR RADIO FOUR.[98][101]   BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AS HOLMES IN SHERLOCK THE 2009 FILM SHERLOCK HOLMES EARNED ROBERT DOWNEY JR. A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF HOLMES AND CO-STARRED JUDE LAW AS WATSON.[102] DOWNEY AND LAW RETURNED FOR A 2011 SEQUEL, SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS. AS OF MAY 2016, A SCRIPT FOR A THIRD FILM WAS SAID TO BE READY AND FURTHER SEQUELS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AS POSSIBLE.[103]  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PLAYS A MODERN VERSION OF THE DETECTIVE (WITH MARTIN FREEMAN AS JOHN WATSON) IN THE BBC ONE TV SERIES SHERLOCK, WHICH PREMIERED ON 25 JULY 2010. IN THE SERIES, CREATED BY MARK GATISS AND STEVEN MOFFAT, THE STORIES' ORIGINAL VICTORIAN SETTING IS REPLACED BY PRESENT-DAY LONDON. CUMBERBATCH'S HOLMES USES MODERN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING TEXTING AND BLOGGING) TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES.[104] SIMILARLY, ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2012, ELEMENTARY PREMIERED ON CBS. SET IN CONTEMPORARY NEW YORK, THE SERIES FEATURES JONNY LEE MILLER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LUCY LIU AS A FEMALE DR. JOAN WATSON.  THE 2015 FILM MR. HOLMES STARRED IAN MCKELLEN AS A RETIRED SHERLOCK HOLMES LIVING IN SUSSEX, IN 1947, WHO GRAPPLES WITH AN UNSOLVED CASE INVOLVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.[105] THE FILM IS BASED ON MITCH CULLIN'S 2005 NOVEL A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.  HOLMES HAS ALSO APPEARED IN VIDEO GAMES, INCLUDING THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SERIES OF EIGHT TITLES. THE DETECTIVE IN THAT SERIES IS BASED ON JEREMY BRETT'S PORTRAYAL, WITH THE PLOTS INDEPENDENT OF THE CONAN DOYLE STORIES.

KLINGER (LAWYER AND EDITOR OF THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES) FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGEMENT SUIT AGAINST THE CONAN DOYLE ESTATE IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS ASKING THE COURT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CHARACTERS OF HOLMES AND WATSON WERE PUBLIC DOMAIN IN THE U.S.[110] THE COURT RULED IN KLINGER'S FAVOUR ON 23 DECEMBER, AND THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED ITS DECISION ON 16 JUNE 2014.[111] THE CASE WAS APPEALED TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, WHICH DECLINED TO HEAR THE CASE, LETTING THE APPEALS COURT'S RULING STAND.

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 - ゾーイ・テルフォード（英語版）（声・小林さやか） ジョンが勤める病院の医師。ジョンの恋人。自己防衛のために多少戦うことは出来る。シーズン2でジョンとニュージーランドへ旅行した後、破局したことが判明。 チャールズ・アウグストゥス・マグヌッセン 演 - ラース・ミケルセン（声・森田順平） ビジネスマンでありメディア王。シーズン3を通しての黒幕。西側諸国の著名人について、ありとあらゆる情報に精通し、個人情報を握ることで政治的影響力を持ち恐喝を行う。『犯人は二人』のチャールズ・オーガスタス・ミルヴァートンの現代版。個人情報の宝庫ともいえる大邸宅「アップルドア」を保有し、シャーロックと交渉することになる。 メアリー・モースタン 演 - アマンダ・アビントン[注釈 14]（声・石塚理恵） シーズン3よりジョン・ワトソンの交際相手として登場し、妻となり懐妊した。しかし、彼女はある秘密についてマグヌッセンに脅迫されていた。 その秘密についてすれ違いから破局を迎えそうになるが、ジョンが彼女を受け入れて許したことから本当の意味で夫婦となる。この時に表面にA.G.R.A.と書かれた、彼女の秘密を記したUSBメモリを渡しているが、ジョンは暖炉に放り込み処分している。 シャーロックの両親 演 - 父：ティモシー・カールトン、母：ワンダ・ヴェンサム[注釈 15]（声・こねり翔、宮沢きよこ） シャーロックとマイクロフトの両親。 エピソードリスト ※放送日はイギリスがBBC ONE、日本がNHK BSプレミアムにおける初放送日。  シーズン1（2010年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 1	1	ピンク色の研究	A STUDY IN PINK	2010年7月25日	2011年8月22日 緋色の研究 "A STUDY IN SCARLET" 2	2	死を呼ぶ暗号	THE BLIND BANKER	2010年8月1日	2011年8月23日 恐怖の谷 "THE VALLEY OF FEAR" 踊る人形 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" 3	3	大いなるゲーム	THE GREAT GAME	2010年8月8日	2011年8月24日 ブルースパーティントン設計書 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS" シーズン2（2012年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 4	1	ベルグレービアの醜聞	A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA	2012年1月1日	2012年7月22日 ボヘミアの醜聞 "A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA" 5	2	バスカヴィルの犬ハウンド	THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE	2012年1月8日	2012年7月29日 バスカヴィル家の犬 "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES" 悪魔の足 "DEVIL'S FOOT" 6	3	ライヘンバッハ・ヒーロー	THE REICHENBACH FALL	2012年1月15日	2012年8月5日 最後の事件 "THE FINAL PROBLEM" 一部、プライオリー・スクール "THE PRIORY SCHOOL" 犯人は二人 "CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON"[注釈 16] クリスマス・ミニエピソード（2013年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国配信日	日本配信日 -	0	幸せな人生を	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	2013年12月24日	2014年5月8日 シーズン3の前日譚を描いた約7分間のミニエピソード。2013年12月24日より、BBC IPLAYER、BBC RED BUTTONおよびYOUTUBEのBBC公式チャンネルで公開された。2014年5月8日からは、NHKオンライン「どーがステーション」およびYOUTUBEとニコニコ動画のNHK公式チャンネルで日本語字幕版が配信されている。 シーズン3（2014年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本放送日 7	1	空からの霊柩車れいきゅうしゃ	THE EMPTY HEARSE	2014年1月1日	2014年5月24日 空き家の冒険 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE" 8	2	三の兆候	THE SIGN OF THREE	2014年1月5日	2014年5月31日 四つの署名 "THE SIGN OF THE FOUR" 9	3	最後の誓い	HIS LAST VOW	2014年1月12日	2014年6月7日 最後の挨拶 "HIS LAST BOW" 犯人は二人 "THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON" 唇のねじれた男"THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP" 特別編（2016年） 通算	シーズン	邦題	原題	英国放送日	日本劇場公開日	日本放送日 10	0	忌まわしき花嫁	THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE	2016年1月1日	2016年2月19日[7][8]	2016年5月9日[9] 舞台をヴィクトリア朝時代の19世紀のロンドンに移した特別編。日本では2016年2月19日に劇場公開された。 タイトルの「忌まわしき花嫁」（THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE）は、『マスグレーヴ家の儀式』の冒頭に登場する語られざる事件"RICOLETTI OF THE CLUB FOOT AND HIS ABOMINABLE WIFE."（内半足のリコレッティと忌まわしい妻）に由来する[10]。 2016年5月9日、NHK BSプレミアムで、プレミアムシネマとして放送された[9]。同局では、シーズン4の放送に合わせた2017年7月3日に再放送が行われる[3]。 2016年7月17日には、AXNミステリーで字幕版がノーカット初放送されている[11]。 シーズン4（2017年） 通算	シーズン	邦題[12][13][14]	原題[15]	英国放送日[16]	日本放送日[3][17] 11	1	六つのサッチャー	THE SIX THATCHERS	2017年1月1日	2017年7月8日 六つのナポレオン "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS" 12	2	臥せる探偵	THE LYING DETECTIVE	2017年1月8日	2017年7月15日 瀕死の探偵 "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE" 13	3	最後の問題	THE FINAL PROBLEM	2017年1月15日	2017年7月22日 受賞 詳細は「LIST OF AWARDS AND NOMINATIONS RECEIVED BY SHERLOCK」を参照 英国アカデミーテレビ賞 (BRITISH ACADEMY TELEVISION AWARDS) 2011年 最優秀ドラマシリーズ賞 （シーズン1） 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジョン・ワトソン役のマーティン・フリーマン） 2012年 最優秀助演男優賞 （ジム・モリアーティ役のアンドリュー・スコット） プライムタイム・エミー賞 2016年 作品賞 （特別編「忌まわしき花嫁」） 製作 本作の特徴としてシャーロックの視線に映る証拠品や人物の状態がモーショングラフィックを使った字幕で表示される演出が挙げられる[18]。これによりシャーロックが捉えた手がかりや情報が視聴者にも視覚的に伝わるよう描かれる他、シーズン3ではシャーロックが得た字幕情報の中に今後の展開の伏線が敷かれていた。この他登場人物がスマートフォンで送受信するメールのメッセージやパスワード入力の場面についても同様である。NHK放送版はこれらのフォローに字幕スーパーを使わず手描きのメッセージに至るまで日本語化表示しており、番組最後の吹き替え版クレジットでもキャスト/スタッフの記名にタッチパネル操作を模した動きを与えている。  また原作に目配せした設定もあちこちに登場する。例えばベーカー街221Bの階段は、原作と同じ17段に揃えられている[19]。フラットの外観はノース・ガウアー・ストリート185番地で撮影されている[19]。一方で、シャーロックとジョンがファースト・ネームで呼び合うなど、現代版ならではの変更も加えられている[20]。  DVDおよびBLU-RAY DISCにはシリーズ1第1話『ピンク色の研究』のパイロット版が収録されており、放送版までには画質、デジタルな視覚効果を絡めた編集の面で試行錯誤があったことを確認出来る。モーショングラフィックを使った字幕演出はまだ考えられていなかったほか、脚本陣は原作に登場しないキャラクターを登場させないつもりだったが、ルイーズ・ブリーリーが好演したため、モリーの出番が増えたという[18]。  各シリーズのラストは次シリーズへの引きで終わるクリフハンガーとなっているが、制作ペースは脚本の完成度を上げる目的もあって新作を毎年放送出来ないという（連続ドラマと比べれば）非常に遅いペースになっている。主演2名のハリウッド映画出演も撮影スケジュールの点で遅さに拍車をかけている。ゲイティスは2名の多忙さにより「シリーズ継続が困難である」と話し、シリーズ4での完結を示唆した。  シリーズ4の製作は2016年後半に予定されていたが[21]、前倒しして同年4月から撮影が始まっている[22][23]。また2016年7月には、サンディエゴで開かれたコミコン・インターナショナルのパネルにて、シリーズ4のキーワードが「サッチャー」「スミス」「シェリンフォード」（英: THATCHER, SMITH, SHERRINFORD）と発表され[24][25][注釈 17]、また新登場人物のトビー・ジョーンズ[26]などが登場する予告動画も公開された[27][28]。ベネディクト・カンバーバッチがタイトルロールを演じた2015年の舞台『ハムレット』にオフィーリア役で出演したシャン・ブルックが第1-2話で“エリザベス”を演じる。  日本での漫画化 日本の月刊青年漫画誌『ヤングエース』（KADOKAWA）で、以下のように漫画版が連載されている。脚本はマーク・ゲイティスとスティーヴン・モファット、作画はJAY.が担当している。連載終了後は、カドカワコミックス・エースより単行本が発売されている。また、単行本は台詞などを英語にしたバイリンガル版も別途販売されている[29]。  タイトル	連載号	単行本（通常版） 発売日、ISBN	単行本（バイリンガル版） 発売日、ISBN SHERLOCK ピンク色の研究	2012年11月号 -

ベネディクト・カンバーバッチ（声・三上哲） 背が高く、暗い色の巻き毛で痩せ型の男。僅かな事柄から物事を類推することを非常に得意とし、自らを「世界で唯一のコンサルタント探偵」「高機能ソシオパス」（英: HIGH-FUNCTIONING SOCIOPATH、吹き替えでは『高機能社会不適合者』・字幕では『社会病質者』とも訳される）と呼ぶ。スコットランド・ヤードが解決困難と判断した殺人事件を謝礼金・支給交通費無しで請け負う。自分を満足させる事件がない、特に依頼が来ない暇な時は拳銃を乱射したり、銛を振り回したりなど常軌を逸した行動をとる。 頭脳明晰だが周囲を小馬鹿にして何事も自身を基準に考える。友人は数少ないことが示唆されている[注釈 1]。 「自身は仕事と結婚している」と言い、恋愛を軽蔑している。検視官のモリー・フーパーには恋愛感情を抱かれているが、それを知りつつ敢えてその気があるように振る舞い情報を得ている[注釈 2]。 「マインド・パレス（精神の宮殿）」という記憶法を用いており、各地の地理や地質そして天気、細菌や暦などに関して非常に深い知識を持っている。またロンドンの道路について一方通行などの情報も含めて詳しい。その一方で、テレビ番組や出演タレントのゴシップ、地動説など興味を持たない分野への知識が全くない。またグラフィティ・アートを描く少年やホームレスのネットワークを「眼と耳」として利用している[注釈 3]。 シーズン2の最終回でマスコミを誘導したモリアーティの謀略により警察から追われ、モリーが勤務する聖バーソロミュー病院の屋上からジョンの見ている前で飛び降り自殺した。直後に駆け寄り脈を確認したジョンにより死亡は明らかだったが、これは兄のマイクロフトとモリーの協力で行われた偽装であり、モリアーティの犯罪組織を解体するため各国を巡り2年で完遂。ロンドンに帰還した。 シーズン3では帰還後に一時仲違いしたジョンの結婚式で「ベストマン」を努め、ジョンがシャーロックを親友とみなしていることに感銘を受け「何があっても僕が君達を守る」という誓いを立てる。しかしこの誓いが原因でシャーロックはある決断を迫られる。 服装や持ち物は非常に高価なブランド品が多い。シーズン1ではBLACKBERRYのスマートフォン・BLACKBERRY BOLD 9700とVAIOのパソコンを使用していたが、シーズン2ではIPHONE 4とMACBOOK PROに機種変更している。喫煙者であるが、禁煙の為にニコチンパッチ依存症であることがシーズン1では描かれている[注釈 4]。兄のマイクロフトとの関係は酷い状態だが、必要に応じ情報交換を行っている。 シーズン3の最終回で自身のフルネームがウィリアム・シャーロック・スコット・ホームズ[注釈 5]であるとジョンに明かした。 ジョン・ヘイミッシュ・ワトソン[注釈 6] 演 - マーティン・フリーマン（声・森川智之） シャーロックの同居人かつ相棒。シャーロックと比べると背が低く、髪は金髪。日常的な買い物や様々な請求書の支払いをシャーロックが一切しないので仕方なく担当している。また事件の捜査に同行し、周囲に気を遣うことのない彼のフォローに回っている。当初シャーロックをゲイと思い、周囲からの「シャーロックとジョンは付き合っている」という誤解を嫌がっている[注釈 7]。 キングス・カレッジ・ロンドンで医学を学び、バーツ（英: BARTS、聖バーソロミュー病院の通称）に勤務した後、アフガン戦争に軍医[注釈 8]として3年派遣された。カンダハール、ヘルマンドで従軍したと語っている。派遣時の所属はロイヤル・ノーサンバーランド・フュージリアーズで、階級は大尉だった。戦地で左肩に銃創を負ったため送還されるが、PTSDに悩まされ左手の断続的な痙攣と右脚を上手く動かすことが出来なくなり杖をついて生活していた。定職につくことも出来ず物価の高いロンドンでの生活を止めようとしていた時に研修医時代の友人スタンフォードと再会、彼の紹介でシャーロックと出会うことになる。シャーロックと一緒に行動することで症状は改善され、シーズン1の1話後半で杖無く歩けるようになり、第2話以降では杖を使っていない。 誠実かつ勇敢で惚れっぽい。シャーロックと違い警察との関係も良く、シャーロックから高い信頼を寄せられるようになる[注釈 9]。FN ブローニング・ハイパワー[注釈 10]を所持し、射撃はシャーロックに名手と呼ばれる程の腕前である。道徳心も持ち合わせ、シャーロックと一度会っただけの時に彼のもとでスパイをするようマイクロフトに頼まれるが断っている。 シーズン1ではルームシェアを始めて以降も金銭的に困っていることは変わらず、近所の病院で働いている。そこで上司の医師サラ・ソーヤーと出会い交際していた（但しシーズン2の時点でサラとは破局している）。 シーズン1、2共に関わる女性の多くに興味を示している。そのため、シャーロックと同性愛の関係に見られることを嫌がっている。 シーズン2ではシャーロックの個人秘書のような立場となり、医師として働いている様子は見られなくなる。サラ以降も何人もの女性とデートを重ねていることが明らかになっている。 シーズン3ではシャーロックの死にショックを受け、なんとか立ち直るまで彼に寄り添っていたメアリーと交際する。そんな中シャーロックが帰還し、ジョンは彼が偽装計画を一切話さなかったことに激怒して一度は仲違いするが、再び彼と共に事件を解いていくことになる。最終話ではメアリーに関するある事件に巻き込まれ、新たな転機を迎える。 ユニクロのジーンズを愛用し、姉のお下がりのNOKIA N97（パイロット版ではIPHONE 3GS）を使用。姉のハリエット（愛称ハリー）とは彼女のアルコール依存症と離婚が原因で関係が悪化している。 スコットランド・ヤード グレッグ・レストレード警部 演 - ルパート・グレイヴス（声・原康義） シャーロックに捜査を依頼する刑事。性格に難があるシャーロックに対しては、その有能さから仕方なく依頼しているものの他の同僚たちと違い露骨な敵意は抱いてない。だが証拠を持ち去られたり、警察手帳をスラれたりすることには不満を抱いている。ニコチンパッチの使用者。モリアーティにはシャーロックの数少ない友人の1人と看做され、本人が気づかない内に人質に取られている。 シーズン3では死んだと思っていたシャーロックの帰還を涙ぐみつつ歓迎し、彼が緊急メールを発すると取り掛かっている事件を放り出して駆けつけるなど厚い友情が描き出されるが、シャーロックは彼のファーストネームをいつも間違える。 フィリップ・アンダーソン[注釈 11] 演 - ジョナサン・アリス（声・内田岳志） 鑑識官で、シャーロックとはお互いに軽蔑しあっている関係。妻がロンドン市内から外出している際、サリーと不倫している。シーズン2ではシャーロックを犯人扱いするサリーに加担する。 シャーロックの「自殺」以降はその罪悪感から海外の難事件解決をシャーロックの生存と結びつける暴走ぶりから失職。更には、私設ファンクラブ「空（から）の霊柩車」で会員達とシャーロック自殺の真相を議論し、偽装の経緯について見当外れな仮説を立ててはレストレードにシャーロック生存を訴えている。これらの経緯を経ていくらか関係性が良好化したのか、シーズン3ではモリーと共にシャーロックの『マインド・パレス』に現れた。 サリー・ドノヴァン 演 - ヴィネット・ロビンソン（声・三鴨絵里子） 巡査部長。アンダーソンと同じくシャーロックを軽蔑し、面と向かって「変人」と呼びかける。ジョンに、シャーロックはサイコパスであり、いつか退屈さを理由に殺人犯を捕まえる方から殺人を犯す方になるのではないかと度々警告している。シャーロックの"自殺"と捜査の誤りからマスコミのバッシングに遭うが、アンダーソンと異なりシーズン3でも解職には至っていない。 その他 ハドソン夫人 演 - ユーナ・スタッブス（声・谷育子） ベーカー街221Bの家主。1階に住んでおり2階をシャーロックとジョンに貸している。彼女の夫がフロリダ州の未解決事件の犯人であるとシャーロックが突き止め、死刑を確定させたことから知り合いになる。「家主であり家政婦ではない」と何度も言うが、2人に対し面倒を見て夕食を作ったりもしている。また、女性に対する扱いが冷淡なシャーロックから唯一温かく接せられている女性でもあり、彼女もモリアーティからシャーロックの友人の1人として目をつけられている。 ストーリーに直接関係したことはないが、「221B横のサンドイッチ店の店員と交際しているが浮気が発覚し破局」（シーズン2第2話）、「インターネットにストリップの映像が載っている」（シーズン3第3話）など隠された謎の私生活があるようで、これらをしばしばシャーロックに気づかれている。 マイクロフト・ホームズ 演 - マーク・ゲイティス[注釈 12]（声・木村靖司） シャーロックの兄。初登場時は正体を明かさずジョンを誘拐し、弟のスパイをして欲しいと要求している。シャーロックとの関係は悪く、体重の増減が激しいことを馬鹿にされている。だがその頭脳は弟以上に明晰で、推理力も上回っている。シャーロック曰く「危険な男」。スマートフォンはBLACKBERRY TORCH 9800を使用。 「英国政府の小さな地位」にあると言うが、街中の監視カメラを勝手に動かせたり他国の大統領選を操作できたりと本人が言う以上に大きな権力を握っていることを仄めかしている。個人秘書のアンシアと行動を共にしている。 特定の部屋以外では口を開いてはいけないという規則を持つ秘密クラブ「ディオゲネス・クラブ（英語版）」の会員である[注釈 13]。 モリアーティを危険視し、尋問を行うものの犯罪の尻尾を掴めずに釈放している。シャーロックの半生を彼に語ったことが弟の窮地を招く原因となってしまった。しかしシーズン3ではこれもモリアーティの地下組織壊滅の為にシャーロックと共に敢えて仕掛けたトラップだったことが語られている。 シーズン3第3話ではシャーロックの処遇を巡り国家レベルの事案に関与している。 モリー・フーパー 演 - ルイーズ・ブリーリー（声・片岡身江） 聖バーソロミュー病院のモルグに勤める法医学者。シャーロックに片想いをしており、彼が死体を調べられるように自らの立場を利用して度々便宜を図っている。シャーロック曰く「化粧をしないと地味な顔」。ボーイフレンドのジムの正体が実はモリアーティだと知らずに交際していたこともある。シャーロックには化粧や服装で中傷に近い言動を受けることも多いが、シーズン2において彼女もジョン達と同じく仲間の一人として認識されていたことが判明し重要な役割を担う。 シーズン3では、第1話でシャーロックと喧嘩したワトソンの代役で事件現場に赴くなど以前よりも親交を深めた様子が描かれるものの、シャーロック似の婚約者をシャーロックたちに紹介する。また第3話ではシャーロックのマインド・パレスにも登場する。 アイリーン・アドラー 演 - ララ・パルヴァー（声・永島由子） 王族や上流階級の男女を相手にしたBDSMサービス提供を仕事としている女性。国家や政府に関わる秘密を抱えており、言動は支配的。 「バッキンガム宮殿の主」から依頼を受けてアイリーンの所有するVERTUのスマートフォンのデータを入手しようとしたシャーロックを、一度は推理の面でも肉体的にも完全に打ち負かした初めての女性。その後、シャーロックに対して何度も誘いのメールを送り続けるが、シャーロックは返信しなかった。シャーロックへのメールにはBLACKBERRY PEARL 3G 9105を使用。自身が持つ切り札をシャーロックに見破られたことで命の危機に晒され、逃亡生活を送る羽目になる。シーズン3では、シャーロックのマインド・パレスに登場する。 ジム・モリアーティ 演 - アンドリュー・スコット（声・村治学） 「世界で唯一のコンサルタント犯罪者」を自称する男。全話の事件の犯人に資金・情報を提供した首謀者であるが自らの手を汚すことを嫌う。シャーロックに強い興味を持ち、また興味が無くなればすぐにでも殺すつもりだと言っている。本作の主要人物は年齢設定が比較的原作に近いが、彼のみ設定が青年となっており、原作の長身痩躯の老人とはかけ離れている。 シャーロック曰く「蜘蛛のような存在」で、犯罪という糸を巡らし、自分は動くことなく悪事をやってのける天才。 頭脳だけでなく演技力にも非常に長けている。シーズン1では同性愛者のふりをして正体を悟られること無くシャーロックとジョンの前に現れ、シーズン2では役者のリチャード・ブルックと名乗って思慮の浅い女性記者に接近し、被害者を装って彼女に捏造記事を書かせている。スマートフォンはHTC INCREDIBLE Sを使用。 その後、暗殺者をロンドンに集め、ジョンやハドソン夫人を人質に取ってシャーロックに飛び降り自殺を強要し、自らも拳銃を咥えて“自殺”する。シーズン3の冒頭で、ブルックの逮捕が伝えられ全てが解決したと思われたが、シーズン3の最後に一般家庭のテレビや街頭テレビ・カーナビなどに "MISS ME?"（会いたかった）とメッセージを喋る演出（口元の部分だけがモゴモゴ動く）を施した写真が流れだし、ラストシーンで振り向きざまに「会いたかった」とメッセージを残した。 サラ・ソーヤー 演 -

رساں کردار، شرلاک ہولمز کی کہانیوں پر مبنی ہے۔ اسٹیون موفیٹ اور مارک گیٹیس کے تخلیق کردہ اس ڈرامے میں، بینڈکٹ کمبربیچ نے شرلاک ہولمز اور مارٹن فریمین نے ڈاکٹر جان واٹسن کا کردار نبھایا ہے۔ 2010ء-2017ء کے دوران، چار سیریز کے تحت اس سلسلے کی تیرہ اقساط نشر ہوچکی ہیں۔ ہر سیریز تین حصوں یا اقساط پر مشتمل تھی، جبکہ ایک خصوصی قسط یکم جنوری 2016ء کو نشر کی گئی۔[2]  شرلاک ہولمز کی اصل کہانیاں وکٹوریائی عہد کے زمانے کا قصہ بیان کرتی ہیں، جبکہ اس ڈرامے میں شرلاک کو دورِ حاضر میں دکھایا گیا ہے۔ یہ برطانوی ادارے، بی بی سی، امریکی اسٹیشن ڈبلیو جی بی ایچ-ٹی وی، اور ہارٹس ووڈ فلمز کی مشترکہ پروڈکشن ہے جبکہ موفیٹ، گیٹیس، سو ورچیو اور ربیکا ایٹون ایگزیکٹیو پروڈیوسر ہیں۔[3][4] ڈرامے کی مرکزی عکس بندی کارڈف، ویلز میں ہوئی، جبکہ ہولمز اور واٹسن کی رہائش گاہ، 221-بی بیکر اسٹریٹ کے لیے لندن کی شمالی گوور اسٹریٹ پر فلمائے گئے ہیں۔  اس ٹی وی سلسلے نے ناقدین کو بہت متاثر کیا اور اس کی تحریر، اداکاری، اور ہدایت کاری کے معیار کو بے حد سراہا گیا۔ ’’شرلاک‘‘ کو کئی اعزازات کے لیے نامزد کیا گیا، جن میں برٹش اکیڈمی ٹیلی ویژن ایوارڈ، ایمی ایوارڈ، اور گولڈن گلوب ایوارڈ شامل ہیں۔ 66ویں پرائم ٹائم ایمی ایوارڈز کے موقع پر، یہ ٹی وی سلسلہ 3 زمروں کے تحت اعزازات اپنے نام کرنے میں کامیاب رہا، جن میں مختصر سیریز، مووی یا ڈرامے کے لیے عمدہ تحریر (موفیٹ)، مختصر سیریز یا فلم میں عمدہ مرکزی اداکار (کمبربیچ)، اور مختصر سیریز یا فلم میں عمدہ معاون اداکار (فریمین) کے اعزازات شامل تھے۔ 2011ء میں اس ٹی وی سلسلے کو پی باڈی اعزاز سے نوازا گیا۔[5] اس کی تیسری سیریز 2001ء سے برطانیہ کی سب سے زیادہ دیکھی جانے والی سیریز بن گئی۔ ’’شرلاک‘‘ 200 سے زائد خطوں میں فروخت ہوا۔[6]  ڈرامے کی تمام سیریز ڈی وی ڈی اور بلیو-رے پر پیش کی جاچکی ہے، جن میں کونن ڈویل کی اصل کہانیاں اور ڈیوڈ آرنلڈ اور مائیکل پرائس کے ترتیب دیے گئے اصل گیت شامل ہیں۔ جنوری 2014ء میں، ڈرامے کی باضابطہ موبائل ایپ، ’’شرلاک: دی نیٹورک‘‘ جاری کی گئی۔[7]

کمبربیچ) ’’مشاورتی سراغ رساں‘‘ ہے جو دورِ حاضر کے جدید لندن میں متعدد معمے حل کرتا ہے۔ ہولمز کو اپنے فلیٹ کے ساتھی اور دوست، ڈاکٹر جان واٹسن (مارٹن فریمین) کی معاونت حاصل ہے جو رائل آرمی میڈیکل کورپس کے ساتھ افغانستان میں فوجی خدمات سر انجام دے کر لوٹا ہے۔ اگرچہ ابتدا میں، میٹروپولیٹن پولیس سروس کا انسپکٹر لیسٹراڈ (روپرٹ گریوز) اور دیگر ہولمز ہی پر شک کرتے ہیں، تاہم اس کی غیر معمولی ذہانت اور مشاہدے کی صلاحیت کو دیکھتے ہوئے وہ اس کی قدر کرنے لگتے ہیں۔ واٹسن اپنے بلاگ پر ہولمز کے قصے شائع کرتا ہے، جس سے ہولمز معروف ہوجاتا ہے۔ چنانچہ برطانوی حکومت اور عام لوگ اس سے مدد کی درخواست کرتے ہیں۔  یوں تو سیریز میں متعدد جرائم اور مجرمان دکھائے گئے ہیں، تاہم ہولمز کا جانی دشمن، جم موریارٹی (اینڈریو اسکاٹ) کئی بار اس کے مقابل آتا ہے۔ سینٹ بارتھولومیوز ہسپتال کی ماہر امراضیات، مولی ہوپر (لوئیس بریلے) کئی مقدمات میں ہولمز کی معاونت کرتی ہے۔ دیگر نمایاں کرداروں میں ہولمز اور واٹسن کی مالک مکان مسز ہڈسن (یونا اسٹبز)، اور ہولمز کا بڑا بھائی مائیکروفٹ (مارک گیٹیس) شامل ہیں۔  پروڈکشن تصور اور ابتدائی مراحل اس سیریز کا خیال اسٹیون موفیٹ اور مارک گیٹیس کو سوجھا، جو شرلاک ہولمز کے مداح اور وکٹوریائی ادب کو ٹیلی ویژن پر پیش کرنے کا تجربہ رکھتے تھے۔[8][9] موفیٹ اس سے قبل، ڈاکٹر جیکل اور مسٹر ہائیڈ کا انوکھا معاملہ 2007ء کے ٹی وی سلسلے، جیکل کے لیے ڈھال چکے تھے، جبکہ گیٹیس نے ڈاکٹر ہو کی ایک قسط ’دی انکوائیٹ ڈیڈ‘ (THE UNQUIET DEAD) لکھی تھی۔ موفیٹ اور گیٹیس، دونوں ہی ’’ڈاکٹر ہو‘‘ کے لکھاریوں میں شامل تھے، اور اس کی پروڈکشن کے لیے بذریعہ ٹرین کارڈف کا مستقل سفر کرتے تھے۔[10] اسی دوران دونوں نے ہولمز کو ٹی وی پر پیش کرنے سے متعلق تبادلۂ خیال کیا۔  مونٹی کارلو میں ایک ایوارڈ تقریب کے موقع پر، پروڈیوسر سو ورچیو نے، جو موفیٹ کی اہلیہ ہیں، موفیٹ اور گیٹیس کو ترغیب دی کہ اس سے پہلے کوئی دوسری ٹیم اس خیال پر کام شروع کرے، انھیں چاہیے کہ وہ اس منصوبے کو آگے بڑھائیں۔[11] چنانچہ دونوں نے اسٹیفن تھومپسن کو ستمبر 2008ء میں اس سیریز کی کہانی لکھنے کی دعوت دی۔[12]  گیٹیس حال ہی میں کونن ڈویل کی ٹی وی پر پیش کردہ کہانیوں سے مطمئن نہیں تھے اور ان کے مطابق وہ بہت سست اور ڈویل کے زمانے کی عکاس تھیں۔ بینڈکٹ کمبربیچ کا شرلاک جرائم کے معمے حال کرنے کے لیے جدید ٹیکنالوجی، بشمول پیغام رسانی، انٹرنیٹ، اور جی پی ایس کا استعمال کرتا ہے۔[8] شرلاک کی دو اقساط کی ہدایات دینے والے، پال مک گوئیگن کے مطابق، ایسا کونن ڈویل کے کردار کو پیشِ نظر رکھتے ہوئے کیا گیا ہے کیونکہ کتابوں میں وہ (شرلاک) ہر ممکن یا دستیاب آلے کا استعمال کرتا تھا اور تجربہ گاہ میں ہر وقت تجربات کرتا رہتا تھا۔ لہٰذا یہ اس کا جدید ورژن ہے۔ اگر وہ اس زمانے میں ہوتا تو سراغ رسانی کے لیے دورِ حاضر کا ہر دستیاب ٹول استعمال کرتا۔[13]  شرلاک کا یہ جدید ورژن کہانی کے بعض روایتی عناصر بھی قائم رکھتا ہے، جیسے کہ بیکر اسٹریٹ کا پتا اور ہولمز کا مخالف کردار، موریارٹی۔ ڈاکٹر واٹسن (مارٹن فریمین) کا کردار افغانستان میں فوجی خدمات انجام دینے کے بعد لوٹا ہے[14]، جبکہ کہانی کا اصل واٹسن دوسری انگریز افغان جنگ (1878ء-1880ء) سے واپس آیا تھا۔  اگست 2008ء میں بین الاقوامی جشن ایڈنبرگ ٹیلی ویژن کے موقع پر ’’شرلاک‘‘ کا واحد 60-منٹ کی پروڈکشن کے طور پر اعلان کیا گیا،[9] جسے وسط تا اواخر 2009ء میں نشر کیا جانا تھا۔[15] ارادہ یہ تھا کہ اگر آزمائشی قسط (پائلٹ) کامیاب رہی تو 60 منٹ کی چھ اقساط پر مشتمل سیریز تیار کی جائے گی۔ دی گارڈین کے مطابق پائلٹ کے پہلے نسخے پر آٹھ لاکھ برطانوی پاؤنڈز کا خرچہ آیا جس سے بی بی سی اور میڈیا میں یہ افواہیں گردش کرنے لگیں کہ ’’شرلاک‘‘ ممکنہ طور پر تباہی ثابت ہو سکتا ہے۔[16][17] بی بی سی نے پائلٹ کی بجائے، دوبارہ عکس بندی کرنے اور مجموعی طور پر 90 منٹ کی تین اقساط تیار کرنے کی درخواست کی۔[16][17] اصل پائلٹ قسط پہلی سیریز کی ڈی وی ڈی میں شامل کیا گیا تھا۔ تخلیقی ٹیم کے مطابق بی بی سی پائلٹ کے ساتھ ’’بہت خوش‘‘ تھا، لیکن اس نے سیریز کا انداز بدلنے کو کہا۔ جولائی 2009ء میں، بی بی سی کے شعبۂ ڈراما نے 90 منٹ کی تین اقساط کے منصوبوں کا اعلان کیا جنھیں 2010ء میں نشر ہونا تھا۔ موفیٹ پہلے ہی کہہ چکے تھے کہ اگر ’’شرلاک‘‘ کی سیریز کا پروانہ ملا تو گیٹیس ایگزیکٹیو پروڈیوسر کے فرائض سنبھالیں گے تاکہ وہ ’’ڈاکٹر ہو‘‘ پر توجہ دے سکیں۔[9]  کرداروں کے لیے اداکاروں کا انتخاب فلم ’’اٹونیمنٹ (2007ء) میں کمبربیچ کی اداکاری دیکھنے کے بعد موفیٹ اور ورچیو سب سے مرکزی کردار کے لیے کمبربیچ ہی کو منتخب کرنے میں دلچسپی رکھتے تھے۔ چنانچہ تخلیقی ٹیم کو اسکرپٹ پڑھ کر سنانے کے بعد انھیں منتخب کر لیا گیا۔ دی گارڈین کے مطابق، کمبربیچ انوکھے اور ذہین شخص کا کردار خوب نبھانے کی شہرت رکھتے ہیں اور ان کا شرلاک بے پروا اور ٹیکنالوجی والا ہے۔ کمبربیچ کا کہنا تھا کہ ’’دماغ میں الفاظ کی تعداد اور خیالات کی رفتار کے باعث، یہ کردار نبھاتے ہوئے آپ میں بہت زیادہ توانائی آجاتی ہے—آپ کو غیر معمولی حد تک تیز ربط بنانے ہوتے ہیں۔ وہ معمولی ذہانت رکھنے والے اپنے ناظرین اور اپنے اردگرد موجود افراد سے ایک قدم آگے رہتا ہے۔‘‘ بی بی سی کیمرو ویلز میں ڈرامے کی سربراہ، پیئرس وینگر کے نزدیک یہ سیریز شرلاک کو جدید زمانے کے سپر ہیرو کے طور پر پیش کرتی ہے جو خود پسند اور اور ذہین سراغ رساں ہے جس کی خواہش ہے کہ وہ خود کو مجرمان اور پولیس، بلکہ ہر شخص سے زیادہ چالاک ثابت کرے۔ سماجی رویوں اور نشریاتی ضوابط میں تبدیلیوں کے پیشِ نظر، کمبربیچ کا ہولمز پائپ پینے کی بجائے متعدد نکوٹین پیچز کا استعمال کرتا ہے۔ بقول موفیٹ، مصنفین کا ماننا تھا کہ شرلاک کو ’’ایک مکمل ماڈرن شخص‘‘ کی طرح بات نہیں کرنی چاہیے، بلکہ ابتدا میں وہ چاہتے تھے کہ وہ بات کرتے ہوئے لیکچر دیتا ہوا بالکل محسوس نہ ہو۔ دوسری سیریز میں موفیٹ نے اسے مزید وکٹوریائی کردار بنایا اور کمبربیچ کی خوبصورت آواز پر توجہ دیتے ہوئے ایسا بنایا کہ وہ لیکچر دیتا ہوا محسوس ہو۔  دی آبزرور کے ساتھ گفتگو میں، شریک تخلیق کار مارک گیٹیس نے کہا کہ انھیں مرکزی کردار سے زیادہ، ڈاکٹر جان واٹسن کا کردار نبھانے والے کو ڈھونڈنا مشکل ثابت ہوا۔ پروڈیوسر سو ورچیو کا کہنا تھا کہ ’’بینڈکٹ وہ واحد شخص تھے جنھیں ہم نے شرلاک کے لیے دراصل دیکھ رکھا تھا۔۔۔ جب بینڈکٹ آ گئے تو ساری کوشش یہ تھی کہ جان (واٹسن) کی کیمسٹری مل جائے—اور میرے خیال میں وہ جیسے ہی کمرے میں داخل ہوں تو آپ جان جائیں کہ یہ دونوں اکٹھے کام کرتے ہیں۔‘‘ واٹسن کا کردار نبھانے کے لیے کئی اداکاروں نے امتحان دیا، اور آخر یہ کردار مارٹن فریمین کے حصے میں آیا۔ بقول اسٹیون موفیٹ، میٹ اسمتھ اس امتحان میں ناکام رہنے والے پہلے شخص تھے۔ انھیں زیادہ ’’احمق‘‘ نظر آنے کی وجہ سے مسترد کر دیا گیا۔ بعد ازاں، موفیٹ نے اسمتھ کو ’’ڈاکٹر ہو‘‘ میں گیارھویں ڈاکٹر کے طور پر منتخب کر لیا۔  بقول مصنفین، فریمین کے انتخاب سے، کمبربیچ کے ہولمز کا کردار نبھانے کی راہ ہموار ہوئی۔ دونوں کے درمیان دوستی کا تصور گیٹیس اور موفیٹ کو بہت بھایا۔ گیٹیس کا کہنا تھا کہ ’’واٹسن احمق ہرگز نہیں ہے، اگرچہ یہ درست ہے کہ کونن ڈویل ہمیشہ اسے نیچا دکھاتے ہیں، لیکن کوئی احمق ہی ہوگا جو اپنے اردگرد احمقوں کو جمع کر رکھے گا۔‘‘ موفیٹ کے نزدیک، فریمین ’’ہر معاملے میں بینڈکٹ کے برعکس ہے، سوائے صلاحیتوں کے۔۔۔‘‘ فریمین نے خود اپنے کردار کو شرلاک کے لیے ’’اخلاقی قطب نما‘‘ کے طور پر بیان کیا، کیونکہ شرلاک عموماً اپنے افعال کی اخلاقیات پر توجہ نہیں دیتا ہے۔  روپرٹ گریوز کو سراغ رساں انسپکٹر گریگ لیسٹراڈ کے کردار کے لیے منتخب کیا گیا۔ ابتدائی مراحل پر مصنفین نے اس کردار کو ’’انسپکٹر لیسٹراڈ‘‘ کا نام دیا تھا، تاہم گیٹیس کو خیال آیا کہ موجودہ انگلستان میں اس کردار کا منصب ’’سراغ رساں انسپکٹر‘‘ ہونا چاہیے۔ موفیٹ اور گیٹیس جانتے تھے کہ لیسٹراڈ کا کردار کہانیوں میں باقاعدگی سے ظاہر نہیں ہوتا، تاہم انھوں نے اس کردار کو وہ شکل دینے کا فیصلہ کیا جیسا اسے ’’دی ایڈونچر آف سکس نپولینز‘‘ میں پیش کیا گیا ہے، یعنی ایک ایسا شخص جو ہولمز سے تنگ بھی ہے لیکن اس کی صلاحیتوں کا معترف بھی ہے، اور ہولمز اسے اسکاٹ لینڈ یارڈ میں سب سے اچھا مانتا ہے۔ کئی امیدواروں نے اس کردار کے لیے امتحان دیتے ہوئے ظریفانہ انداز اپنایا، لیکن تخلیقی ٹیم کو وہ سنجیدگی اور متانت پسند آئی جو گریوز کے انداز میں تھی۔  اینڈریو اسکاٹ پہلی بار جم موریارٹی کے کردار میں ’’دی گریٹ گیم‘‘ میں جلوہ گر ہوئے۔ موفیٹ کے مطابق، ’’ہم شروع ہی سے جانتے تھے کہ ہم موریارٹی کے ساتھ کام کرنا چاہتے تھے۔ موریارٹی عموماً کچھ احمق اور کچھ خوش پوش بدمعاش ہے، لہٰذا ہم نے کسی ایسے شخص کے بارے میں سوچا جو حقیقتاً خوفناک لگتا ہو۔ کوئی ایسا جو پورا نفسیاتی ہو۔‘‘  دیگر اداکاروں میں یونا اسٹبز شامل ہیں (جو کمبربیچ کو چار سال کی عمر سے جانتی ہیں، کیونکہ انھوں نے کمبربیچ کی ماں، وینڈا وینتھم کے ساتھ کام کیا تھا) جنھوں نے مسز ہڈسن کا کردار نبھایا جبکہ مارک گیٹیس نے مائیکروفٹ ہولمز کا۔  ایمنڈا ابینگٹن، جو ان دنوں حقیقی زندگی میں بھی مارٹن فریمین کی شریکِ حیات تھیں، ڈرامے میں واٹسن کی محبوبہ اور پھر بیوی کا کردار نبھایا۔ تیسری سیریز میں، کمبربیچ کے حقیقی والدین، وینڈا وینتھم اور ٹھموتھی کارلٹن کو شرلاک اور مائیکروفٹ کے والدین کے طور پر متعارف کروایا گیا۔  پروڈکشن اور عکس بندی موسیقی اداکار کردار	اداکار	سیریز سیریز 1 (2010)	سیریز 2 (2012)	سیریز 3 (2014)	خاص (2016)	سیریز 4 (2017) مرکزی شرلاک

للمحقق شرلوك هولمز، من إبداع ستيفن موفات ومارك جاتس وبطولة بيندكت كامبرباتش بدور شرلوك هولمز و مارتن فريمان بدور دكتور واطسون. أُنتجت 13 حلقة من المسلسل عُرضت الثلاث الأولى منها سنة 2010، وعُرض الموسم الثاني من المسلسل سنة 2012، تبعه الموسم الثالث بتاريخ يناير 2014. كما تكلَّف المنتج التنفيذي ستيفن موفات بعمل الموسم الرابع الذي عُرض سنة 2017.[1] تم بيع المسلسل لأكثر من 200 منطقة.[2]  خطرت فكرة المسلسل لموفات وجاتس أثناء رحلة ذهابٍ وإيابٍ لهما لمدينة كارديف عندما كانا كاتبَين في مسلسل دكتور هو، وكانت الفكرة إنتاج نسخةٍ معاصرةٍ لأعمال آرثر كونان دويل؛ حيث يستعمل شرلوك هولمز التقنيات الحالية المتاحة له لمساعدته على حلّ الجرائم، وكمشارِكَين في إبداع المسلسل، عمل كلٌّ من موفات وجاتس على كتابة حلقةٍ واحدةٍ من كل موسمٍ، بينما الحلقات الأخرى كتبها ستيفن تومبسون. أنتجت أفلام هارتسوود السلسلة لصالح بي بي سي بمشاركةٍ من WGBH بسبب عملها على مسلسل تحفة فنية. صُوّر المسلسل رئيسياً في مدينة كارديف، وفي مجموعةٍ من الأماكن الأخرى أيضاً، واستُعمل شارع جاور في لندن كواجهةٍ لشارع 221ب بيكر وهو الشارع الذي يعيش فيه هولمز وواطسون.  المسلسل يصوّر شرلوك هولمز وهو "محققٌ مستشارٌ" يُساعد شرطة ميتروبوليتان، على الأخص المحقق المفتش جريج لستراد (روبرت غريفز) أثناء حلّه للجرائم، يُساعد هولمز زميله في السكن د. جون واطسون الذي عاد من خدمته العسكرية، وعلى الرغم من أن المسلسل يعرض جرائماً مختلفةً، إلا أنه يعرض وبشكلٍ مستمرٍ صراع هولمز مع عدوه اللدود جيم مورياتي (أندرو سكوت). من حينٍ لآخر، تُساعد عالمة الأمراض مولي هوبر (لويز بريلي) شرلوك لحلّ قضاياه. تشمل الأدوار الأخرى أونا ستابس بدور السيدة هدسن ومارك جاتس بدور مايكروفت هولمز الشقيق الأكبر لشرلوك.  بعد حلقةٍ غير معروضةٍ في 2009، عُرض الموسم الأول المتضمن لثلاث حلقاتٍ كلٌّ منها مدتها 90 دقيقة على بي بي سي وان وبي بي سي إتش دي في 2010، ثم بُث الموسم الثاني في 2012 تلاه حلقةٌ خاصةٌ قبل انطلاق الموسم الثالث في يناير 2014. الاستقبال النقدي كان إيجابياً بشكلٍ كبيرٍ، فقد حصل المسلسل على العديد من المراجعات التي تمدح جودة الحبكة وأداء الممثلين والإخراج. رُشّح مسلسل شرلوك للعديد من الجوائز مثل جوائز الأكاديمية البريطانية لبرامج التلفزيون، وجوائز الإيمي، وفاز بالعديد منها في فئاتٍ مختلفةٍ.  أُصدرت المواسم الثلاث التي عُرضت حتى الآن على أقراص دي في دي وبلو راي، إلى جانب إضافات أخرى لحفنة مختارة من أعمال السير آرثر كونان دويل، والموسيقى التصويرية من تأليف دافيد أرنولد ومايكل برايس. وفي يناير 2014 أطلق البرنامج تطبيقه المحمول الرسمي المسمى "شرلوك: الشبكة" (بالإنجليزية: SHERLOCK: THE NETWORK).[3][4] وفي 2 يوليو 2014 أعلن عن تجديد المسلسل لموسم رابع يتكون من ثلاث حلقات، تم تصويره مع بداية سنة 2016، وذلك بعد عرض الحلقة الخاصة بمناسبة عيد الميلاد لسنة 2015 والتي ابتدأ العمل على تصويرها منذ يناير من السنة سالفة الذكر.[5][6] أشار مارك جاتس أن الموسم الجديد سيشهد قيام هولمز وواطسون بالعديد من المغامرات الجديدة المثيرة التي لم يسبق لهما أن خاضاها قبلًا، وأن طاقم العمل كله متحمس للعودة مجددًا.[7] على أن مصادر أخرى نصت على أن تأخر تصوير الموسم الرابع يعود إلى ازدحام جدول بطليه مارتن فريمان وبيندكت كامبرباتش بعد حصولهما على مسيرة سينمائية ناجحة. وأشار ستيفن موفات الكاتب المشارك للمسلسل أنه لم يتوقع أن يتجاوز شرلوك موسمه الثالث، وأنه كان على فريق الإنتاج إقناع بطليه سالفا الذكر بالعودة إليه بعد أن لم يعودا بحاجة إليه بسبب تجربتهما السينمائية.[8]  وفي شهر أبريل من سنة 2016 ابتدأ العمل في تصوير الموسم الرابع من المسلسل على أن يظهر على شاشات التلفاز خلال سنة 2017. وكان مارك جاتس قد كتب مؤكدًا أن الموسم الرابع سيكون مثل سابقه، أي يبدأ بحلقة خاصة ثم تليه 3 حلقات طويلة.[9] هذا وأشار المنتج ستيفن موفات أن الموسم الرابع من الممكن أن يصبح الأخير، وذلك نظرًا لاحتمالية عدم تمكن بطل المسلسل بيندكت كامبرباتش من المشاركة في المواسم القادمة نظرًا لانشغاله،[10] على أنه تراجع عن هذا التصريح لاحقاً بعد أن أعلن عن عزمه إنتاج موسم خامس من المسلسل.  قال أحد النقاد بأن هذا المسلسل يسرد الأحداث بطريقة عبقرية وتفصيل ذكي ويبني الشخصيات بأسلوب مميز ودرامي في التعمق في جوانبهم الإنسانية نوعاً ما. وأضاف أنه بغض النظر عن الجانب الدرامي في العمل إلا أن العمل "يقدم متعة خالصة ووجبة مثيرة ومميزة جداً للمتابع". كما قال أنه على الرغم من أن كل حلقة عبارة عن ساعة ونصف مما يجعلها أقرب إلى الأفلام الكاملة، غير أنها متصله بأحداثها. واعتبر أن المميز في المسلسل هو أنه حوّل قصص شرلوك هولمز وأعطاها الحداثة والتطور في العالم "أي أنه أعطاها بعداً جديداً من الناحية الفنية في مجال كتابة الأحداث وسردها بطريقة تكون أكثر جاذبية وإقناع عن أن يكون العمل يسرد في حقبة قديمة من الزمن". على أن كثير من عشاق شخصية شرلوك هولمز انتقدوا المسلسل على هذا التغيير وإضافة الحداثة فيه وفضلوا النسخ الأصلية منه التي تقع أحداثها خلال العصر الفكتوري[11] في القرن التاسع عشر كما قدمها السير آرثر كونان دويل في رواياته. على أن بعض عناصر الروايات الأصلية استمرت قائمة ولو بنكهة حديثة، ومنها على سبيل المثال استبدال شرلوك القرن الحادي والعشرين غليونه الشهير بلاصقات النيكوتين، في حين احتفظ بملامح أساسية مثل قبعته ومعطفه، وعزفه على الكمان.[12]  محتويات 1	الإنتاج 1.1	الفكرة والتطوير 1.2	طاقم التمثيل والشخصيات 1.3	تصميم الإنتاج والتصوير 1.4	الموسيقى 2	المواسم

عمل موفات سابقاً على رواية قضية الدكتور جيكل والسيد هايد الغريبة في مسلسل جيكل الذي صدر سنة 2007،[14] بينما عمل جاتس على حلقة مسلسل دكتور هو الموتى المضطربون.[15] كلٌّ من موفات وجاتس كانا كاتبين في مسلسل دكتور هو، وقد ناقشا فكرة تبني قصة مسلسل شرلوك أثناء رحلاتهما المتعددة إلى مدينة كارديف وهي مركز إنتاج مسلسل دكتور هو.[16] وبينما كانا في مدينة مونت كارلو من أجل حفل توزيع جوائزٍ، شجّعتهما المنتجة سو فرتيو على تطوير الفكرة بأنفسهم قبل أن يسبقهم إليها فريقٌ آخرٌ.[17] ثم قام الاثنان بدعوة ستيفن تومبسون للعمل معهم في سبتمبر 2008.[18]  انتقد جاتس الأعمال التلفزيونية السابقة التي تبنّت فكرة شرلوك هولمز حيث قال أنها بطيئةٌ جدّاً، لأن غالبيتها صُوِّرت في فترة الحرب العالمية الثانية.[19] يستعمل شرلوك هولمز في المسلسل أنواعاً مختلفةً من التكنولوجيا الحديثة، مثل: الرسائل النصية وشبكة الإنترنت وحتى نظام التموضع العالمي لحلّ الجرائم.[19] قال بول ماكجيجان بأن هذا حفاظٌ على عمل كونان دويل، مشيراً إلى أن هولمز في الرواية كان ليستخدم أيّ جهازٍ، وأنه كان دائماً في المختبر يقوم بالتجارب، وأن المسلسل مجرد نسخةٍ معاصرةٍ للرواية.[20]  هذه النسخة المعاصرة حافظت على بعض عناصر القصة الأصليّة، مثل شارع بايكر، وخصم شرلوك اللدود مورياتي.[21] على الرّغم من أن أحداث القصة تم نقلها إلى الحاضر، فإن بعض الأحداث لم يتم تغييرها كليّاً، على سبيل المثال، فإن جون واطسون في المسلسل عاد من خدمته العسكرية في الحرب أفغانستان، بينما واطسون في القصص الأصلية عاد من الحرب الأنغلو-أفغانستانية الثانية،[22] وقد قال جاتس: "إنها الحرب نفسها الآن. الحرب الخاسرة نفسها".[19]  كان من المقرر أن تكون مدة المسلسل 60 دقيقةً حسب ما أُعلِن في مهرجان إدنبرة الدولي للتلفزيون في أغسطس 2008،[13] وقُرِّر أن يُبث المسلسل في منتصف إلى أواخر سنة 2009.[21] على كلٍّ، ذكرت صحيفة الغارديان أن ميزانية الحلقة التّجريبيّة قُدِّرت ب800.00 جنيه إسترليني وذكرت الصحيفة أيضاً إشاعاتٍ تقول أنّ الحلقة التجريبيّة كانت كارثةً كبيرةً.[23] قرّرت البي بي سي بعدها عدم بث الحلقة، طالبةً إعادة تصوير ثلاث حلقاتٍ كاملةٍ مدّتها 90 دقيقة.[23][24]  طاقم التمثيل والشخصيات  بيندكت كامبرباتش (شرلوك هولمز)     مارتن فريمان (جون واطسون)     مارك جاتس (مايكروفت هولمز)     روبرت غريفز (جريج ليستراد)     لويز بريلي (مولي هوبر)     أندرو سكوت (جيم مورياتي)  بيندكت كامبرباتش بدور شرلوك هولمز: عبقريّ، وتقريباً لا يستطيع التعامل مع الآخرين. شرلوك هو شابٌّ فريدٌ له عقلٌ شبيهٌ ب"محرك سيارة سباق"، وهو في حاجةٍ دائمةٍ لحلِّ المعضلات والقضايا المعقّدة، وكلّما كانت هذه المعضلات أكثر تعقيداً وغرابةً كلما كان الأمر أفضل. وهو يعتبر نفسه المحقق الإستشاري الوحيد في العالم.[25][26] أصبح موفات مهتمّاً بالممثل بيندكت كامبرباتش بعد أدائه في فيلم تكفير، و وافق الممثل على أداء دور شرلوك بعد مطالعة السيناريو.[27] قالت صحيفة الغارديان عن كامبرباتش: "لديه سمعة كبيرة في أداء الأدوار الغريبة وأدوار العباقرة، وأداؤه لدور هولمز رائع جداً ومبدع ومضطرب قليلًا".[28] اعتقد الكتّاب أن شخصية شرلوك لا يجب أن تتحدث مثل "إنسان عصريّ"، كي لا يبدو وكأنه يلقي "محاضرةً"[29]. لكن تم تغيير هذا في الموسم الثاني من المسلسل.  مارتن فريمان بدور جون واطسون: شجاع و واسع الحيلة وعملي. عمل سابقاً كطبيب في الجيش، وتحطمت معنوياته في حرب أفغانستان. وجد واطسون شكلا جديداً للحياة عندما قابل شرلوك، بالرَّغم من أنه يعتبر هذا الأخير صديقه المفضل فإنه يغتاظ من برودته وطرقه الملتوية.[30] خضع العديد من الممثلين لتجربة أداء دور جون واطسون [31] قال مارك جاتس في مقابلةٍ له مع صحيفة ذا أوبزرفر، أنهم واجهوا صعوبةً أكبر في إيجاد الممثل المناسب للعب دور الدكتور جون واطسون.[19] حيث قالت سو فرتيو: "بيندكت كان هو الشخص الوحيد المناسب لدور هولمز، بعدما حصلنا عليه كان علينا فقط أن نجد الشخص المناسب لدور جون واطسون، وحالما تجمعهما في غرفة وحيدة ستعرف أنهما مناسبان للعمل معاً".[32]  مارك جاتس بدور مايكروفت هولمز: شقيق شرلوك الأكبر. يعمل مايكروفت لدى الحكومة البريطانية ويدّعي أن دوره في الحكومة بسيط، لكن الحقيقة عكس ذلك. هو يطلب غالباً المساعدة من شقيقه في حال وُجِدت حالات تهدّدُ أمن الدولة. مايكروفت متوتر وأحياناً بارد المشاعر، ويشفق على أسلوب حياة شرلوك غير التقليدي.[33] أندرو سكوت بدور جيم مورياتي: عبقريٌّ مجنون. مورياتي هو عدوّ شرلوك اللدود، وهو عقل إجراميٌّ وشخص يحب التلاعب بالآخرين.[34] ظهر أندرو سكوت لأوّل مرةٍ بدور جيم مورياتي في حلقة "اللعبة العظيمة. قال موفات: "عرفنا منذ البداية ما يجب فعله مع شخصية مورياتي، فهو تارةً ممل، وتارةً أخرى شرير ٌأنيق، وشخص مضطرب العقل تماماً."[32] في البداية قرّر جاتس وموفات أن لا تكون هناك مواجهة بين هولمز ومورياتي لكن سرعان ما أدركا أنه يجب صنع نسخةٍ من مشهد المشكلة الأخيرة حيث يتواجه العدوَّان.  روبرت غريفز بدور جريج ليستراد: هو أفضل من يمكن لسكوتلاند يارد أن تقدمّه، لكنه يعرف أن شرلوك أفضل منه. شخصٌ ضجرٌ معظم الوقت وغالباً ساخر. ليستراد هو الشرطي الوحيد الذي يُكنُّ شرلوك له الإحترام، وغالباً ما يطلب من شرلوك أن يفحص مسرح الجريمة بالرغم من سخرية زملائه منه.[35] حصل روبرت غريفز على دور المفتش جريج ليستراد. وهكذا كان اسم الشّخصية في البداية حتى قرر مارك جاتس أنه في الوقت الحاليّ يجب أن يُشار إليه بـ "المحقق المفتش". أشار موفات وجاتس أن ليستراد لا يظهر كثيراً في القصص ويظهر فيها بشكل متغيّر، لذلك قرّرا اختيار شخصيّة ليستراد التي ظهرت في رواية "ستة من نابليون". حيث أن ليستراد في الرواية هو شخصٌ غاضبٌ من هولمز وفي نفس الوقت يحترمه، ويعتبر هولمز في الرواية ليستراد أفضل مفتش في جهاز الشرطة البريطانية.[17] كان هناك الكثير من المرشحين للحصول على الدور لكن فريق الإبداع فضل الجاذبية والوقار التي أضافها غريفز للشخصية.[17]  لويز بريلي بدور مولي هوبر: تعمل مولي في مستشفى القديس برثولماوس، مُعتادة على العمل مع الأموات، وبالرّغم من قلة مهاراتها الإجتماعية فهي حادة الذكاء.[36] أماندا أبينجتون بدور ماري مورستان: ماري هي ممرضة بدوام جزئي، قابلت واطسون بعد وفاة شرلوك، ولا يعرف أحد ماضيها الكامل.[37] جوناثن أريس بدور فيليب أندرسون: يحب الظهور بمظهر الذكي. يعمل لدى قسم الطب الشرعي في سكوتلاند يارد، دمرت حياته بعد وفاة شرلوك حيث أصبح مهووساً بالكشف عن حقيقة هذا الموت المزعوم، مما تسبب في طرده من عمله.[38] أونا ستابس بدور السيدة هدسون: هي صاحبة الشقة التي يسكن فيها شرلوك وواطسون، وهي تحب هذين الأخيرين وهما يحبانها أيضاً.[39] تصميم الإنتاج والتصوير أُنتج المسلسل من قبل هارتسوود فيلمز لصالح بي بي سي والز، وقدمت بي بي سي حول العالم دعماً ماليّاً للإنتاج.[13][40] ودُعِم المسلسل أيضاً من قبل بوبليك برودكاستنغ سيرفيس. بدأ بتاريخ يناير 2009 تصوير الحلقة التّجريبيّة وتمت كتابتها من قِبل موفات وأُخرجِت من قبل ماري روس-هيلين.[41] وفي يناير الموالي (2010) دخلت المجموعة الأولى من ثلاث حلقات مرحلة الإنتاج، حيث أخرج بول ماكجيجان الحلقتين الأولى والثالثة بينما أخرج أوريس لين الحلقة الثانية.[42][43] تم تصوير الحلقات بترتيب عكسي من موعد البث.   استخدم شارع جاور في لندن لتصوير بعض المشاهد لمسكن شرلوك هولمز.[44] تمركز إنتاج الموسمين الأوّلَين في آبر بوت ستوديو بمدينة كارديف وهو مركز الإنتاج ذاته لمسلسل دكتور هو.[45][46] فكارديف أكثر اقتصادية من لندن، مع أماكن أفضل. على كلٍ، بعض المعالم لم يكن بالاستطاعة تزييفها لذلك كان عليهم العودة للعاصمة لتصوير بعض المشاهد.  الملابس للحلقة التجريبية صمّمها راي هولمان وهو حائزٌ على جائزة الأكاديميّة البريطانيّة لبرامج التلفزيون لأفضل تصميم أزياء.[47] وقد شرحت سارة آرتشر وهي مصَمِّمة أزياء المسلسل كيف حقّقت مظهر المحقق، حيث يرتدي هولمز معطفاً أسود من نوع BELSTAFF[48] وقالت سارة بخصوص هذا: "لم يكن هولمز ليهتم بالموضة لذلك اخترت مظهراً تقليدياً مع لمسة عصريّة - لقد بدا الأمر رائعاً خلافاً لأفق مدينة لندن."[48]  قال كُتّاب المسلسل أنهم لم يودّوا فرض الحداثة على القصة.[17] حيث واجهتهم بعض المشاكل في صناعة المسلسل مثل تضمين علامة "221B" في الباب الأمامي لمنزل هولمز وأشار جاتس وموفات على أنه في الوقت الحاضر سيكون على الباب رقم المنزل فقط وستوجد أجراس في كل شقة، لكن رقم المنزل كاملًا مشهور ومهم لذلك لم يستطيعوا تغييره.[17] وأيضاً قرر أن الشخصيات الرئيسية ستنادي بعضها البعض بالأسماء الأولى بدلًا من التقليديّ هولمز وواطسون.[17] وأتى المخرج بول ماكجيجان بفكرة كتابة الرّسائل على الشاشة عوض إظهار هواتف الشخصيّات وهم يقرؤون رسائلهم.[17]   مارتن فريمان وبيندكت كامبرباتش أثناء تصوير الموسم الثالث من المسلسل وجد المنتجون صعوبة في تنسيق جداول العمل نظراً لضيق الوقت فقد عمل كامبرباتش وفريمان على فيلم الهوبيت بينما استمر موفات عمله كرئيس الكتاب في مسلسل دكتور هو. وقد قال جاتس أنه قد كانت مناقشات حول القصص التي ستظهر في المسلسل طيلة ثلاث سنواتٍ وقد استبعد قصة "متعة مؤجلة".[49] أيضاً تطورت العلاقة بين هولمز وواطسون أثناء الموسم الثاني لكون هذا الأخير أقل انبهاراً بقدرات شرلوك في التحقيق، ولعبه دور المحقق الرئيسي في قضية "كلاب آل باسكرفيل".[49] ولكن كلاَّ من طاقم التمثيل والإنتاج كانا واثقين أثناء الموسم الثاني بعد ردِّ فعل الجمهور والنقاد الذي كان إيجابياً.[29][50]  الموسيقى الموسيقى الافتتاحيّة للمسلسل والموسيقى الثانويّة من تأليف دافيد أرنولد ومايكل برايس.[27] شرح أرنولد أنه وبرايس عمل مع المنتجين "للخروج بموسيقى افتتاحيّة رئيسيةٍ للمسلسل والشخصيّات"، ليجدوا بعدها "ما بدا أنه ما سيحدد المسلسل."[27] تمت صناعة بعض الأجزاء بواسطة جهاز تأليف الصورة لكن المقطوعات تم تسجيلها من قبل موسيقيين حقيقيين.[27]  المواسم CRYSTAL CLEAR APP KDICT.PNG مقالة مفصلة: قائمة حلقات شرلوك تم إنتاج أربعة مواسم يتضمن كل واحدٍ منها ثلاث حلقات، وقد بدأ عرض الموسم الأول في يوليو وأغسطس 2010 على قناة بي بي سي، وعُرِض أيضاً على بوبليك برودكاستنغ سيرفيس في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية بتاريخ أكتوبر 2010.[51] الموسم الثاني من ثلاث حلقات أيضاً عرض لأول مرة في المملكة المتحدة بتاريخ يناير 2012 ثم في الولايات المتحدة بتاريخ مايو من نفس السّنة.[52] وعرض الموسم الثالث في المملكة المتحدة في 1 يناير 2014 وفي الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية بتاريخ 19 يناير 2014. بعدها تم عرض حلقة خاصة في فبراير 2016. في يناير 2017 عرض الموسم الرابع كذلك من 3 حلقات. تم بيع المسلسل لأكثر من 200 منطقة.[2]  الموسم الأول كُتِبت الحلقة الأولى من الموسم من قبل موفات وتم إخراجُها من قبل بول ماكجيجان، وهي بعنوان "دراسة في اللون الوردي" وقد بنيت أساساً على رواية دراسة بالقرمزي، تصور الحلقة قصة التقاء هولمز بالدكتور واطسون، ثم دخولهما في تحقيق عن مجموعة من الوفيات اعتقد أنها حالات انتحار. تم بثُّ الحلقة في وقت واحدٍ على قناتي بي بي سي وبي بي سي إتش دي بتاريخ 25 يوليو 2010.[53][54]  عُرضت الحلقة الثانية بعنوان "المصرفي الأعمى" بتاريخ 1 أغسطس 2010 وكتبها ستيفن تومبسون وأخرجها أوريس لين. وتعرض الحلقة تعيين صديق قديم لهولمز في قضية اقتحام بنك في مدينة لندن.[55]  ينتهي الموسم الأول بحلقة بعنوان "اللعبة العظيمة" وتم بثّها لأول مرة بتاريخ 8 أغسطس 2010، من كتابة مارك جاتس وإخراج بول ماكجيجان. وتظهر شخصية جيم مورياتي لأول مرة في هذه الحلقة، هذا الأخير الذي يضع هولمز في سباق زمنيٍّ لحل مجموعة من الجرائم تبدو غير متصلة، و تنتهي الحلقة بنهايةٍ مشوقةٍ حيث يقف كلٌّ من جيم ومورياتي أمام قنبلةٍ أُلصِقت على جون واطسون.[56] الحلقة من كتابة مارك جاتس وإخراج بول ماكجيجان.  الموسم الثاني  أثناء تصوير مشهد انتحار شرلوك في حلقة "سقوط رايشنباخ" من الموسم الثاني. بعد التقييم العالي لحلقة الموسم الأول "دراسة في اللون الوردي" أصبحت إذاعة بي بي سي متحمسةً لإنتاج حلقاتٍ أكثر.[57] وبتاريخ 10 أغسطس 2010 أُكِّد أن المسلسل سيحظى بموسم ثانٍ،[32] وأعلن مارك جاتس عن القصص التي سيتبنّاها المسلسل وأنّ كل كاتب من كتّاب الموسم الأول سيكتب حلقةً من الموسم الثاني.[58] قال جاتس: "بعد نجاح الحلقة الأولى من المسلسل عرفنا أي القصص سنستخدم" وهي "فضيحة في بوهيميا" و"كلاب آل باسكرفيل" و"المشكلة الأخيرة". وقد أخرج بول ماكجيجان الحلقتين الأولى والثانية،[59] " أما المخرج توبي هاينز أخرج الحلقة الأخيرة.[60] وقُرر بث الموسم في أواخر سنة 2011،[61] لكن تم تأجيله حتى أوائل سنة 2012.  كتب موفات حلقة "فضيحة في بلجرافيا" مستنداً على رواية "فضيحة في بوهيميا" وأخرجها بول ماكجيجان، وتم بثها بتاريخ 1 يناير 2012. وتعرض القصة تلقي هولمز طلباً لإسترجاع صورٍ لشخصيةٍ مَلكيّة موجودةٍ على هاتف امرأةٍ تدعى آيرين آدلر وهي امرأة قوية تقوم ببيع المعلومات السرية التي تقوم بأخذها من شخصياتٍ غنيةٍ وذات نفوذ.[62]  أما مارك جاتس فكتب حلقة "كلاب آل باسكرفيل" استناداً على قصة "كلب آل باسكرفيل" التي تُعد واحدةً من أشهر قصص كونان دويل، وقد قال جاتس أنه شعر بمسؤولية تضمين تفاصيل أكثر في القصص المشهورة من القصص غير المعروفة كثيراً.[63][64] ويلعب الممثل راسل توفي دور هنري نايت وهو ابن لرجل مزّقه كلب ضخم قبل عشرين عاماً. أخرج الحلقة بول ماكجيجان وتم عرضها بتاريخ 8 يناير 2012.[65] كتب ستيف تومبسون الحلقة الأخيرة بعنوان "سقوط رايشنباخ" وأخرجها توبي هاينز والذي قام بإخراج العديد من حلقات مسلسل دكتور هو، وتم بثّها بتاريخ 15 يناير 2012. وتعرض الحلقة مؤامرة مورياتي لتشويه سمعة شرلوك وقتله، وتنتهي الحلقة بانتحار هولمز بينما واطسون ينظر.[66] الحلقة مكتوبة بناء على قصة "المشكلة الأخيرة" حيث يلقى كل من هولمز ومورياتي حتفهما ويسقطان من شلال رايشنباخ في سويسرا. شعر موفات وجاتس أنه في نسختهما من القصة يجب على هولمز أن يهزم مورياتي وقال موفات أنه في نقاش طويل جداً كان ذلك هو الشيء الوحيد الذي غاب عن الجميع.[67]  حلقة عيد الميلاد القصيرة عرضت بي بي سي وان أثناء عيد ميلاد سنة 2013 بعنوان "عودة سعيدة" وهو موجود على موقعها على الإنترنت،[68] وأيضاً على خدمات التلفاز التفاعلي (فقط في المملكة المتحدة).  ملخص الحلقة يقول: "رحل شرلوك لمدة سنتين، لكن شخصاً ما ليس مقتنعاً تماماً أنه ميت."[69] ويتّضح أن هذا 'الشخص' هو فيليب أندرسون وهو طبيب شرعيّ ظهر في الموسم الأول والثاني من المسلسل، وخسر عمله بسبب هوسه لإقناع النّاس بأن هولمز ما زال حيّاً، وبالرغم من أنه لا يثق بشرلوك لكن بالرغم من ذلك كان من القلائل الذين آمنوا بأن شرلوك حي. وتعرض الحلقة أندرسون وهو يحاول إقناع المحقق ليستراد بأن شرلوك ما زال حياً عن طريق بعض القضايا في نيودلهي وألمانيا حيث يبدو أن هذا الأخير (شرلوك) متورط في حلها، ويستشهد أندرسون أن أماكن القضايا تقترب تدريجيّاً من لندن.  الموسم الثالث أعلن موفات وجاتس على تويتر بعد انتهاء الموسم الثاني أن الموسم الثالث جاهز،[70] وأن حلقة "سقوط رايشنباخ" تم تصويرها بالتزامن مع الموسم الثالث،[66] ولكن بدون أن يكشفا إن كان مورياتي قد زيّف موته أيضاً، واقترح موفات أن لا يظهر هذا الأخير بشكل كبير في المستقبل.[71][72]  أخرج الحلقة الأولى من الموسم الثالث جيريمي لوفرين وكتبها مارك جاتس تحت عنوان "الأكفان الفارغة". وعرضت بتاريخ 1 يناير 2014، وتعرض الحلقة عودة شرلوك هولمز إلى لندن وجمع شمله مع جون واطسون ومهمة حل لغز شبكة سريّة إرهابيّة.  و كتب ستيفن تومبسون ومارك جاتس وستيفن موفات حلقة علامة الثلاثة مستندين على قصة علامة الأربعة.[73][74] وتعرض الحلقة زواج واطسون بماري مورستان،[75] وتجري أحداث الحلقة في قاعة الحفل ويتم عرض القصة بناء على ذكريات الماضي.  أما الحلقة الأخير بعنوان "آخر نذر له" فكتبها ستيفن موفات وأخرجها نيك هارن، وأذيعت على قناة بي بي سي وان بتاريخ 12 يناير 2014. وتعرض الحلقة الصراع بين تشارلز أوغسطس ماغنسن وهو شرير مرعب يملك معلومات كثيرة تقريباً عن كل شخص، وقد ذُكِر بدون اسم في المسلسل سابقاً في الحلقة الأولى،[76] ويعتبر الشخصيّة الشريرة الرئيسية في الموسم الثالث.[77] يحاول شرلوك وواطسون القبض على تشارلز لكن تبوء محاولتهما بالفشل فيقوم شرلوك بقتله، ثم يقرر مايكروفت ترحيل أخيه من المملكة المتحدة عوض محاكمته بتهمة القتل، وبينما تقلع الطائرة التي تحمل شرلوك على متنها تعرض كل شاشة تلفاز في لندن صورة لمورياتي، فتعود الطائرة ليساعد في حل قضية عودة مورياتي المزعومة.  الموسم الرابع عبّر كامبرباتش وفريمان عن رغبتهما للعمل على موسم رابع على الرغم من مديري إذاعة بي بي سي التنفيذيين لم يقرروا إن كان سيوجد موسم رابع.[78] وبعد ذلك أعلن ستيفن موفات أنه سيتم العمل على موسم رابع وأن العمل على السيناريو بدأ بالفعل.[1] كما قال لصحيفة التلغراف أن "الجميع متحمس للمزيد وأنه ومارك جاتس لديهما التزامات أخرى لكن الأمر مسألة تنظيم وقتٍ لا غير".[79] وقد أعلن الاثنان أنهما وضعا قصة للموسم الرابع.[80]  أعلنت شركة بي بي سي أن عرض المسلسل سيبدأ سنة 2016، وأن تصويره سيبدأ سنة 2015،[81][82] وسيكون موقع المسلسل في كوريا الشمالية في محاولة منهم "لتشجيع التغيير" في البلد.[83] كما سيضيفون حلقة إضافية ستعرض أثناء عيد الميلاد.[84] ابتدأ تصوير الموسم الرابع في 4 أبريل 2016،[85] واستمر حتى 5 أغسطس من ذات السنة.[86][87] وتقرر تأجيل عرضه على شاشات التلفاز حتى سنة 2017.[88][89] وفي شهر مايو 2016 أعلن عن اختيار توبي جونز ليلعب دور أحد الأشرار.[90]  الموسم الخامس في يناير 2014 أعلن ستيفن موفات أن موسماً خامساً عمل على إعداده بالتعاون مع مارك جاتس،[91] كما أكد بيندكت كامبرباتش أنه وقع عقداً للظهور في موسم خامس من السلسلة.[92]  نسب المشاهدة والبث حول العالم بلغ متوسط عدد مشاهدي الموسم الأول من المسلسل 8.8 مليون مشاهد، حيث بلغ عدد مشاهدات الحلقة الأولى 9.23 مليون مشاهد، والحلقة الثانية 8.07 والحلقة الثالثة 9.18.[93]  بينما وصل متوسط عدد مشاهدي الموسم الثاني 10.2 مليون مشاهد، حيث بلغ عدد مشاهدات الحلقات الثلاث على التوالي 10.66 و10.27 و9.78 مليون مشاهدة[93]، وكانت حلقات الموسم الثاني الأعلى مشاهدة على خدمة بي بي سي تحت الطّلب بين يناير وأبريل 2012.[94] أثارت حلقة "فضيحة في بلجرافيا" جدلا واسعاً في صحيفة الديلي ميل التي قالت أن المشهد الذي ظهرت فيه آيرين آدلر عاريةً قابل استنكاراً من بعض المشاهدين حيث قالوا أن المشهد ظهر قبل الساعة التاسعة مساء حيث أن المشاهد الموجهة للكبار لا يفترض أن يتم عرضها في ذلك الوقت.[95][96] وقال بعض النّقاد أن معاملة موفات للمثلة كانت ذات طابعٍ جنسيٍّ.[97] بينما رفض آخرون من ضمنهم موفات هذا الإفتراض.[98][99] كما أثارت الخاتمة "سقوط رايشنباخ" نقاشاتٍ وجدالاتٍ على المنتديات والمواقع الاجتماعية وكذلك الصحف حول انتحار شرلوك.[99]  وأصبح الموسم الثالث أعلى مسلسلٍ دراميٍّ مشاهدةً المملكة المتحدة منذ 2001.[100] حيث بلغ متوسط عدد المشاهدات للموسم 11.8 مليون مشاهد، ووصلت مشاهدات الحلقات على التوالي 12.72 للحلقة الأولى و11.38 للحلقة الثانية والثالثة.[93]  الجدول التالي يعرض تاريخ بثّ الموسم الأول للمرة الأولى في كل

الطماطم الفاسدة حصل كلٌّ من الموسم الأول والثاني على تقييم 100%.[103] وللحلقة الأولى تقييم عالٍ جداً في سجل التقديرات.[104][105] قالت صحيفة ذا أوبزرفر عن المسلسل: "هو تقاطع بين فيلم 'ويثنيل وأنا' وفيلم إنذار بورن، هناك أيضا لمحةٌ دراميةٌ من مسلسل دكتور هو، مبهر جداً بما أنه مكتوب من قبل مارك جاتس وستيفن موفات."[106] وقال دان مارتن من صحيفة الغارديان: "الوقت مبكِّر، لكن حلقة 'دراسة في اللون الوردي' واعدة جداً، شبيهة بمسلسل 'الأشباح' لكنها تملك الرائع شرلوك هولمز، لحظات الإستنتاج رائعة، والقصة المتشابكة هي من كلاسيكيات موفات."[107] كتب توم ساتكليف لمجلة ذي إندبندنت، "مسلسل شرلوك رائع وسلس بدون التقليل من تميز وبراعة القصة الأصلية. المسلسل يدرك أن شخصية هولمز ليست بالقصة بل بالجاذبية، وبالرغم من أنه يحذف بعض الأشياء من القصة الأصلية لكنه وفيّ بشكل رائع لكلّ تلك الأمور المهمة."[108] وحصل الممثلون الرئيسيون على مديح أيضاً حيث قالت الناقدة فيكتوريا ثورب، "واطسون الذي مثله فريمان جدير بالثقة وكفؤ ومنفتح على هولمز الذي يعتبر نفسه معتلا اجتماعياً."[106] وأكدت سارة كرومبتون لصحيفة التيليغراف بعد الحلقة الافتتاحيّة للموسم الثاني أن "كامبرباتش جعل من المسلسل أفضل تصوير لشرلوك هولمز في وقتنا هذا."[109]  التقييمات منح روبرت بيانكو من صحيفة يو إس إيه توداي الموسم الأول تقييم 100% على موقع ميتاكريتيك حيث كتب:" سلسلة ألمعية ومضحكة ومخلصة لخيال كونان دويل كما غرست فيها لمسةً من الحضارة."[110] وكتبت نانسي سميث من جريدة وول ستريت جورنال: "القصص دقيقة متكاملة ومعاصرة، هزلية في نفس الوقت، إنها رائعة جداً بشكل غريب."[111]  كما قُوبل الموسم الثاني باستحسان أيضاً حيث كتبت ليندا ستاسي من صحيفة نيويورك بوست:"كل أسبوع، تعرض السلسلة حلقةً من كلاسيكيات شرلوك هولمز، تُحدثها وتجعلها شيئاً غير اعتيادي ثم تتركك عاجزاً عن الكلام."."[112]  وكحال الموسمين السابقين، فقد لقي الموسم الثالث استحساناً من النقاد، مدح ديفيد يغان من صحيفة سان فرانسيسكو كرونيكل حيث كتب: "الأداء الآن أفضل من السنوات السابقة مع جوانب جديدة وكاملة من شخصيّتيّ هولمز وواطسون، وكتابة جاتس وموفات لا مثيل لها."[113]  أُعجب محبو كونان دويل بالمسلسل، قال جويلم مومفورد لصحيفة الغارديان: "خلاصة القول أن موفات وجاتس على درايةٍ كاملةٍ بأعمال كونان دويل وكل أعمال شرلوك هولمز التي ظهرت على الشاشة الكبيرة والصغيرة والقصص الأصليّة أيضاً."[49] وقال سام ولاستون من صحيفة الغارديان مستشهداً بحلقة "سقوط رايشنباخ" أن المسلسل مخلص لكونان دويل.[114]  الإشادات CRYSTAL CLEAR APP KDICT.PNG مقالة مفصلة: قائمة الجوائز والترشيحات التي حصل عليها شرلوك فازت السلسلة بعدد من الجوائز والترشيحات منها: جائزة الأكاديميّة البريطانيّة للتلفزيون لأفضل سلسلة دراميّة وجائزة جماهير يوتيوب[115]، وفاز فريمان بجائزة أفضل ممثل في دور مساعد لدوره دكتور واطسون، إضافة للممثل أندرو سكوت الذي أدى دور جيم مورياتي السنة الموالية في الموسم الثاني الذي رشح في فئاتٍ أخرى[116]، وترشح كامبرباتش لجائزة أفضل ممثل. بالنسبة للحلقات فقد ترشحت حلقتا "دراسة في اللون الوردي" و"فضيحة في بلجرافيا" لجائزة الإيمي في عدة فئاتٍ.[117][118]  قالت ديبنهامز بأن شعبية المسلسل زادت في طلبات المعاطف المشابهة لشرلوك، أعادت شركة الملابس الألمانية BELSTAFF المعطف الذي لبسه كامبرباتش لمرحلة التصنيع قبل انتهاء السلسلة.[119] وكتبت صحيفة ذي إندبندنت أن المصمم بول كستيلو انتقل لتلبية الطلبات مقدماً معاطف وأوشحةٍ بناءً على السلسلة، بينما قال الخياط جون بيرس أنّ العديد من زبائنه كانوا يسألون عن ملابس الممثلين.[48] علّق الصحفيُّ ألكسيس بيتريدس على الأمر قائلا: "تستطيع أن تفهم لماذا أراد الرجال الحصول على ذلك المظهر، ربما لاحظوا تأثير كامبرباتش، ولا أقصد وسامته التي أثّرت على النساء المشاهدات، ربما يتعلق الأمر بالقسوة، فسُتدهش عندما تعلم أن أيقونة الموضة في بريطانيا هو مختل اجتماعي وتراه لأول مرة يضرب جثة بسوط. طبعاً حتى محقق ماهر لم يكن ليتوقع أن هذا سيحدث."[119] أعلن الناشرون وتجار التجزئة عن ارتفاعٍ بنسبة 180 بالمئة في مبيعات الكتب المتعلقة بشرلوك خلال الموسم الأول من السلسلة.[120] أيضاً، أعلن مطعم الشطائر سبيدي المتواجد تحت شقة شرلوك عن ارتفاع حادٍّ في عدد الزّبائن الذين عرفوا المطعم من المسلسل[121]. نشر موقع بي بي سي أونلاين عدة مواقع على

"ستة من نابليون".[156] على المواقع وصلاتٌ قد تربط مع مذكرات مولي هوبر والموقع الرسمي لكوني برانس.  في يناير 2014، أطلق المسلسل تطبيق هاتف رسمياً له يطلق عليه شرلوك: الشبكة والذي تم إنشاؤه من قبل ذا بروجكت فاكتوري بالتعاون مع أفلام هارتسود.[3][4]  العلاقة مع مسلسل الإبتدائية الإبتدائية هو تصوير آخر لقصص شرلوك هولمز بدأ عرضه على قناة سي بي إس بعد سنتين فقط من أول عرض لشرلوك في المملكة المتحدة. في يناير 2012 قالت سو فرتيو لصحيفة ذي إندبندنت "نتفهّم أن سي بي إس يصورون نسختهم المحدثة الخاصة من شرلوك هولمز، هذا مثير للإهتمام، ولقد استفسرونا عن إعادة تصوير برنامجنا. وفي الوقت الحالي، لقد ضمنوا التزامهم، لذلك علينا أن نفترض أن شرلوك هولمز خاصتهم لن يشابه خاصتنا بأية طريقةٍ كانت، وإلا فإن ذلك سيكون مقلقاً جداً."[157] وقالت الشهر اللاحق: "لقد تواصلنا مع قناة سي بي إس ولقد أعلمناهم بأنّنا سنمعن النظر في الحلقة الأولى من مسلسلهم لأي خرق لحقوقنا."[158]  وقالت سي بي إس عن المشكلة: "إن مشروعنا هو تصوير جيّد لشرلوك هولمز والذي سيكون مبنياً على هولمز وواطسون وبقية الشخصيات في نطاق عام كما الشخصيات الرئيسية. نحن بالطبع محترمون لقوانين الطبع والنشر ولن نخرق أي قصص أو أعمال ما زالت محمية."[158]  ناقش المنشئ روبرت دوهرتي الفروقات بين شرلوك والإبتدائية، مشيراً إلى أن عادة تحديث قصص هولمز هي عائدة إلى أفلام باسيل راثبون، ولا يظن أن مسلسل الإبتدائية قد يأخذ شيئاً من مسلسل شرلوك الذي وصفه بالمسلسل "اللامع" بما أنه شاهد موسمه الأول.[159] لاحقاً بعد عدة أشهر أكدت لوسي لو بأن منتجي كلا المسلسلين قد

سراغ رساں کردار، شرلاک ہولمز کی کہانیوں پر مبنی ہے۔ اسٹیون موفیٹ اور مارک گیٹیس کے تخلیق کردہ اس ڈرامے میں، بینڈکٹ کمبربیچ نے شرلاک ہولمز اور مارٹن فریمین نے ڈاکٹر جان واٹسن کا کردار نبھایا ہے۔ 2010ء-2017ء کے دوران، چار سیریز کے تحت اس سلسلے کی تیرہ اقساط نشر ہوچکی ہیں۔ ہر سیریز تین حصوں یا اقساط پر مشتمل تھی، جبکہ ایک خصوصی قسط یکم جنوری 2016ء کو نشر کی گئی۔[2]  شرلاک ہولمز کی اصل کہانیاں وکٹوریائی عہد کے زمانے کا قصہ بیان کرتی ہیں، جبکہ اس ڈرامے میں شرلاک کو دورِ حاضر میں دکھایا گیا ہے۔ یہ برطانوی ادارے، بی بی سی، امریکی اسٹیشن ڈبلیو جی بی ایچ-ٹی وی، اور ہارٹس ووڈ فلمز کی مشترکہ پروڈکشن ہے جبکہ موفیٹ، گیٹیس، سو ورچیو اور ربیکا ایٹون ایگزیکٹیو پروڈیوسر ہیں۔[3][4] ڈرامے کی مرکزی عکس بندی کارڈف، ویلز میں ہوئی، جبکہ ہولمز اور واٹسن کی رہائش گاہ، 221-بی بیکر اسٹریٹ کے لیے لندن کی شمالی گوور اسٹریٹ پر فلمائے گئے ہیں۔  اس ٹی وی سلسلے نے ناقدین کو بہت متاثر کیا اور اس کی تحریر، اداکاری، اور ہدایت کاری کے معیار کو بے حد سراہا گیا۔ ’’شرلاک‘‘ کو کئی اعزازات کے لیے نامزد کیا گیا، جن میں برٹش اکیڈمی ٹیلی ویژن ایوارڈ، ایمی ایوارڈ، اور گولڈن گلوب ایوارڈ شامل ہیں۔ 66ویں پرائم ٹائم ایمی ایوارڈز کے موقع پر، یہ ٹی وی سلسلہ 3 زمروں کے تحت اعزازات اپنے نام کرنے میں کامیاب رہا، جن میں مختصر سیریز، مووی یا ڈرامے کے لیے عمدہ تحریر (موفیٹ)، مختصر سیریز یا فلم میں عمدہ مرکزی اداکار (کمبربیچ)، اور مختصر سیریز یا فلم میں عمدہ معاون اداکار (فریمین) کے اعزازات شامل تھے۔ 2011ء میں اس ٹی وی سلسلے کو پی باڈی اعزاز سے نوازا گیا۔[5] اس کی تیسری سیریز 2001ء سے برطانیہ کی سب سے زیادہ دیکھی جانے والی سیریز بن گئی۔ ’’شرلاک‘‘ 200 سے زائد خطوں میں فروخت ہوا۔[6]  ڈرامے کی تمام سیریز ڈی وی ڈی اور بلیو-رے پر پیش کی جاچکی ہے، جن میں کونن ڈویل کی اصل کہانیاں اور ڈیوڈ آرنلڈ اور مائیکل پرائس کے ترتیب دیے گئے اصل گیت شامل ہیں۔ جنوری 2014ء میں، ڈرامے کی باضابطہ موبائل ایپ، ’’شرلاک: دی نیٹورک‘‘ جاری کی گئی۔[7]  فہرست  1	مقدمہ 2	پروڈکشن 2.1	تصور اور ابتدائی مراحل 2.2	کرداروں کے لیے اداکاروں کا انتخاب 2.3	پروڈکشن اور عکس بندی 2.4	موسیقی 3	اداکار 4	اقساط 5	حوالہ جات 6	بیرونی روابط مقدمہ شرلاک ہولمز (بینڈکٹ کمبربیچ) ’’مشاورتی سراغ رساں‘‘ ہے جو دورِ حاضر کے جدید لندن میں متعدد معمے حل کرتا ہے۔ ہولمز کو اپنے فلیٹ کے ساتھی اور دوست، ڈاکٹر جان واٹسن (مارٹن فریمین) کی معاونت حاصل ہے جو رائل آرمی میڈیکل کورپس کے ساتھ افغانستان میں فوجی خدمات سر انجام دے کر لوٹا ہے۔ اگرچہ ابتدا میں، میٹروپولیٹن پولیس سروس کا انسپکٹر لیسٹراڈ (روپرٹ گریوز) اور دیگر ہولمز ہی پر شک کرتے ہیں، تاہم اس کی غیر معمولی ذہانت اور مشاہدے کی صلاحیت کو دیکھتے ہوئے وہ اس کی قدر کرنے لگتے ہیں۔ واٹسن اپنے بلاگ پر ہولمز کے قصے شائع کرتا ہے، جس سے ہولمز معروف ہوجاتا ہے۔ چنانچہ برطانوی حکومت اور عام لوگ اس سے مدد کی درخواست کرتے ہیں۔  یوں تو سیریز میں متعدد جرائم اور مجرمان دکھائے گئے ہیں، تاہم ہولمز کا جانی دشمن، جم موریارٹی (اینڈریو اسکاٹ) کئی بار اس کے مقابل آتا ہے۔ سینٹ بارتھولومیوز ہسپتال کی ماہر امراضیات، مولی ہوپر (لوئیس بریلے) کئی مقدمات میں ہولمز کی معاونت کرتی ہے۔ دیگر نمایاں کرداروں میں ہولمز اور واٹسن کی مالک مکان مسز ہڈسن (یونا اسٹبز)، اور ہولمز کا بڑا بھائی مائیکروفٹ (مارک گیٹیس) شامل ہیں۔  پروڈکشن تصور اور ابتدائی مراحل اس سیریز کا خیال اسٹیون موفیٹ اور مارک گیٹیس کو سوجھا، جو شرلاک ہولمز کے مداح اور وکٹوریائی ادب کو ٹیلی ویژن پر پیش کرنے کا تجربہ رکھتے تھے۔[8][9] موفیٹ اس سے قبل، ڈاکٹر جیکل اور مسٹر ہائیڈ کا انوکھا معاملہ 2007ء کے ٹی وی سلسلے، جیکل کے لیے ڈھال چکے تھے، جبکہ گیٹیس نے ڈاکٹر ہو کی ایک قسط ’دی انکوائیٹ ڈیڈ‘ (THE UNQUIET DEAD) لکھی تھی۔ موفیٹ اور گیٹیس، دونوں ہی ’’ڈاکٹر ہو‘‘ کے لکھاریوں میں شامل تھے، اور اس کی پروڈکشن کے لیے بذریعہ ٹرین کارڈف کا مستقل سفر کرتے تھے۔[10] اسی دوران دونوں نے ہولمز کو ٹی وی پر پیش کرنے سے متعلق تبادلۂ خیال کیا۔  مونٹی کارلو میں ایک ایوارڈ تقریب کے موقع پر، پروڈیوسر سو ورچیو نے، جو موفیٹ کی اہلیہ ہیں، موفیٹ اور گیٹیس کو ترغیب دی کہ اس سے پہلے کوئی دوسری ٹیم اس خیال پر کام شروع کرے، انھیں چاہیے کہ وہ اس منصوبے کو آگے بڑھائیں۔[11] چنانچہ دونوں نے اسٹیفن تھومپسن کو ستمبر 2008ء میں اس سیریز کی کہانی لکھنے کی دعوت دی۔[12]  گیٹیس حال ہی میں کونن ڈویل کی ٹی وی پر پیش کردہ کہانیوں سے مطمئن نہیں تھے اور ان کے مطابق وہ بہت سست اور ڈویل کے زمانے کی عکاس تھیں۔ بینڈکٹ کمبربیچ کا شرلاک جرائم کے معمے حال کرنے کے لیے جدید ٹیکنالوجی، بشمول پیغام رسانی، انٹرنیٹ، اور جی پی ایس کا استعمال کرتا ہے۔[8] شرلاک کی دو اقساط کی ہدایات دینے والے، پال مک گوئیگن کے مطابق، ایسا کونن ڈویل کے کردار کو پیشِ نظر رکھتے ہوئے کیا گیا ہے کیونکہ کتابوں میں وہ (شرلاک) ہر ممکن یا دستیاب آلے کا استعمال کرتا تھا اور تجربہ گاہ میں ہر وقت تجربات کرتا رہتا تھا۔ لہٰذا یہ اس کا جدید ورژن ہے۔ اگر وہ اس زمانے میں ہوتا تو سراغ رسانی کے لیے دورِ حاضر کا ہر دستیاب ٹول استعمال کرتا۔[13]  شرلاک کا یہ جدید ورژن کہانی کے بعض روایتی عناصر بھی قائم رکھتا ہے، جیسے کہ بیکر اسٹریٹ کا پتا اور ہولمز کا مخالف کردار، موریارٹی۔ ڈاکٹر واٹسن (مارٹن فریمین) کا کردار افغانستان میں فوجی خدمات انجام دینے کے بعد لوٹا ہے[14]، جبکہ کہانی کا اصل واٹسن دوسری انگریز افغان جنگ (1878ء-1880ء) سے واپس آیا تھا۔  اگست 2008ء میں بین الاقوامی جشن ایڈنبرگ ٹیلی ویژن کے موقع پر ’’شرلاک‘‘ کا واحد 60-منٹ کی پروڈکشن کے طور پر اعلان کیا گیا،[9] جسے وسط تا اواخر 2009ء میں نشر کیا جانا تھا۔[15] ارادہ یہ تھا کہ اگر آزمائشی قسط (پائلٹ) کامیاب رہی تو 60 منٹ کی چھ اقساط پر مشتمل سیریز تیار کی جائے گی۔ دی گارڈین کے مطابق پائلٹ کے پہلے نسخے پر آٹھ لاکھ برطانوی پاؤنڈز کا خرچہ آیا جس سے بی بی سی اور میڈیا میں یہ افواہیں گردش کرنے لگیں کہ ’’شرلاک‘‘ ممکنہ طور پر تباہی ثابت ہو سکتا ہے۔[16][17] بی بی سی نے پائلٹ کی بجائے، دوبارہ عکس بندی کرنے اور مجموعی طور پر 90 منٹ کی تین اقساط تیار کرنے کی درخواست کی۔[16][17] اصل پائلٹ قسط پہلی سیریز کی ڈی وی ڈی میں شامل کیا گیا تھا۔ تخلیقی ٹیم کے مطابق بی بی سی پائلٹ کے ساتھ ’’بہت خوش‘‘ تھا، لیکن اس نے سیریز کا انداز بدلنے کو کہا۔ جولائی 2009ء میں، بی بی سی کے شعبۂ ڈراما نے 90 منٹ کی تین اقساط کے منصوبوں کا اعلان کیا جنھیں 2010ء میں نشر ہونا تھا۔ موفیٹ پہلے ہی کہہ چکے تھے کہ اگر ’’شرلاک‘‘ کی سیریز کا پروانہ ملا تو گیٹیس ایگزیکٹیو پروڈیوسر کے فرائض سنبھالیں گے تاکہ وہ ’’ڈاکٹر ہو‘‘ پر توجہ دے سکیں۔[9]  کرداروں کے لیے اداکاروں کا انتخاب فلم ’’اٹونیمنٹ (2007ء) میں کمبربیچ کی اداکاری دیکھنے کے بعد موفیٹ اور ورچیو سب سے مرکزی کردار کے لیے کمبربیچ ہی کو منتخب کرنے میں دلچسپی رکھتے تھے۔ چنانچہ تخلیقی ٹیم کو اسکرپٹ پڑھ کر سنانے کے بعد انھیں منتخب کر لیا گیا۔ دی گارڈین کے مطابق، کمبربیچ انوکھے اور ذہین شخص کا کردار خوب نبھانے کی شہرت رکھتے ہیں اور ان کا شرلاک بے پروا اور ٹیکنالوجی والا ہے۔ کمبربیچ کا کہنا تھا کہ ’’دماغ میں الفاظ کی تعداد اور خیالات کی رفتار کے باعث، یہ کردار نبھاتے ہوئے آپ میں بہت زیادہ توانائی آجاتی ہے—آپ کو غیر معمولی حد تک تیز ربط بنانے ہوتے ہیں۔ وہ معمولی ذہانت رکھنے والے اپنے ناظرین اور اپنے اردگرد موجود افراد سے ایک قدم آگے رہتا ہے۔‘‘ بی بی سی کیمرو ویلز میں ڈرامے کی سربراہ، پیئرس وینگر کے نزدیک یہ سیریز شرلاک کو جدید زمانے کے سپر ہیرو کے طور پر پیش کرتی ہے جو خود پسند اور اور ذہین سراغ رساں ہے جس کی خواہش ہے کہ وہ خود کو مجرمان اور پولیس، بلکہ ہر شخص سے زیادہ چالاک ثابت کرے۔ سماجی رویوں اور نشریاتی ضوابط میں تبدیلیوں کے پیشِ نظر، کمبربیچ کا ہولمز پائپ پینے کی بجائے متعدد نکوٹین پیچز کا استعمال کرتا ہے۔ بقول موفیٹ، مصنفین کا ماننا تھا کہ شرلاک کو ’’ایک مکمل ماڈرن شخص‘‘ کی طرح بات نہیں کرنی چاہیے، بلکہ ابتدا میں وہ چاہتے تھے کہ وہ بات کرتے ہوئے لیکچر دیتا ہوا بالکل محسوس نہ ہو۔ دوسری سیریز میں موفیٹ نے اسے مزید وکٹوریائی کردار بنایا اور کمبربیچ کی خوبصورت آواز پر توجہ دیتے ہوئے ایسا بنایا کہ وہ لیکچر دیتا ہوا محسوس ہو۔  دی آبزرور کے ساتھ گفتگو میں، شریک تخلیق کار مارک گیٹیس نے کہا کہ انھیں مرکزی کردار سے زیادہ، ڈاکٹر جان واٹسن کا کردار نبھانے والے کو ڈھونڈنا مشکل ثابت ہوا۔ پروڈیوسر سو ورچیو کا کہنا تھا کہ ’’بینڈکٹ وہ واحد شخص تھے جنھیں ہم نے شرلاک کے لیے دراصل دیکھ رکھا تھا۔۔۔ جب بینڈکٹ آ گئے تو ساری کوشش یہ تھی کہ جان (واٹسن) کی کیمسٹری مل جائے—اور میرے خیال میں وہ جیسے ہی کمرے میں داخل ہوں تو آپ جان جائیں کہ یہ دونوں اکٹھے کام کرتے ہیں۔‘‘ واٹسن کا کردار نبھانے کے لیے کئی اداکاروں نے امتحان دیا، اور آخر یہ کردار مارٹن فریمین کے حصے میں آیا۔ بقول اسٹیون موفیٹ، میٹ اسمتھ اس امتحان میں ناکام رہنے والے پہلے شخص تھے۔ انھیں زیادہ ’’احمق‘‘ نظر آنے کی وجہ سے مسترد کر دیا گیا۔ بعد ازاں، موفیٹ نے اسمتھ کو ’’ڈاکٹر ہو‘‘ میں گیارھویں ڈاکٹر کے طور پر منتخب کر لیا۔  بقول مصنفین، فریمین کے انتخاب سے، کمبربیچ کے ہولمز کا کردار نبھانے کی راہ ہموار ہوئی۔ دونوں کے درمیان دوستی کا تصور گیٹیس اور موفیٹ کو بہت بھایا۔ گیٹیس کا کہنا تھا کہ ’’واٹسن احمق ہرگز نہیں ہے، اگرچہ یہ درست ہے کہ کونن ڈویل ہمیشہ اسے نیچا دکھاتے ہیں، لیکن کوئی احمق ہی ہوگا جو اپنے اردگرد احمقوں کو جمع کر رکھے گا۔‘‘ موفیٹ کے نزدیک، فریمین ’’ہر معاملے میں بینڈکٹ کے برعکس ہے، سوائے صلاحیتوں کے۔۔۔‘‘ فریمین نے خود اپنے کردار کو شرلاک کے لیے ’’اخلاقی قطب نما‘‘ کے طور پر بیان کیا، کیونکہ شرلاک عموماً اپنے افعال کی اخلاقیات پر توجہ نہیں دیتا ہے۔  روپرٹ گریوز کو سراغ رساں انسپکٹر گریگ لیسٹراڈ کے کردار کے لیے منتخب کیا گیا۔ ابتدائی مراحل پر مصنفین نے اس کردار کو ’’انسپکٹر لیسٹراڈ‘‘ کا نام دیا تھا، تاہم گیٹیس کو خیال آیا کہ موجودہ انگلستان میں اس کردار کا منصب ’’سراغ رساں انسپکٹر‘‘ ہونا چاہیے۔ موفیٹ اور گیٹیس جانتے تھے کہ لیسٹراڈ کا کردار کہانیوں میں باقاعدگی سے ظاہر نہیں ہوتا، تاہم انھوں نے اس کردار کو وہ شکل دینے کا فیصلہ کیا جیسا اسے ’’دی ایڈونچر آف سکس نپولینز‘‘ میں پیش کیا گیا ہے، یعنی ایک ایسا شخص جو ہولمز سے تنگ بھی ہے لیکن اس کی صلاحیتوں کا معترف بھی ہے، اور ہولمز اسے اسکاٹ لینڈ یارڈ میں سب سے اچھا مانتا ہے۔ کئی امیدواروں نے اس کردار کے لیے امتحان دیتے ہوئے ظریفانہ انداز اپنایا، لیکن تخلیقی ٹیم کو وہ سنجیدگی اور متانت پسند آئی جو گریوز کے انداز میں تھی۔  اینڈریو اسکاٹ پہلی بار جم موریارٹی کے کردار میں ’’دی گریٹ گیم‘‘ میں جلوہ گر ہوئے۔ موفیٹ کے مطابق، ’’ہم شروع ہی سے جانتے تھے کہ ہم موریارٹی کے ساتھ کام کرنا چاہتے تھے۔ موریارٹی عموماً کچھ احمق اور کچھ خوش پوش بدمعاش ہے، لہٰذا ہم نے کسی ایسے شخص کے بارے میں سوچا جو حقیقتاً خوفناک لگتا ہو۔ کوئی ایسا جو پورا نفسیاتی ہو۔‘‘  دیگر اداکاروں میں یونا اسٹبز شامل ہیں (جو کمبربیچ کو چار سال کی عمر سے جانتی ہیں، کیونکہ انھوں نے کمبربیچ کی ماں، وینڈا وینتھم کے ساتھ کام کیا تھا) جنھوں نے مسز ہڈسن کا کردار نبھایا جبکہ مارک گیٹیس نے مائیکروفٹ ہولمز کا۔  ایمنڈا ابینگٹن، جو ان دنوں حقیقی زندگی میں بھی مارٹن فریمین کی شریکِ حیات تھیں، ڈرامے میں واٹسن کی محبوبہ اور پھر بیوی کا کردار نبھایا۔ تیسری سیریز میں، کمبربیچ کے حقیقی والدین، وینڈا وینتھم اور ٹھموتھی کارلٹن کو شرلاک اور مائیکروفٹ کے والدین کے طور پر متعارف کروایا گیا۔  پروڈکشن اور عکس بندی موسیقی اداکار کردار	اداکار	سیریز سیریز 1 (2010)	سیریز 2 (2012)	سیریز 3 (2014)	خاص (2016)	سیریز 4 (2017) مرکزی شرلاک
